What percentage of your training is anaerobic?

I mainly run the 800, sometimes the 400 and occasionally the 200. My coach is a sprint coach and most of my workouts are sprint workouts. The longest he has me do is 600m. My hardest track workouts are for example 600, 300, 200, 80. I just feel like this isn’t hard enough :/

To “compromise“ for that, I do longer runs like weekly long runs (8-15km), 3-5km tempo, and easy runs by myself usually.

This is because my brother who’s two years older than me is really bad at track, specifically sprints. He started exactly when I plan to start. We were both the same level at that age to. I might even be slightly worse. I’m really afraid I’m gonna be terrible because my brother is. He honestly does everything right and practices as much as everyone else but he’s still really bad. What can I do to avoid being so bad at track? The only flaw I ever noticed is a slightly bad posture while sprinting. What can I do to be at least mid-tier on my team.

Here's an overview of me,

I'm 15, ~142lbs & 5'8 (no idea if that helps)

I was an okayish runner before quarantine, having hit a pr of 10.9 in the beep test. (Grade 7) Haven't done track before though. I gained weight and was very lazy, I hit a peak weight of 160lbs at one point, so I decided to join track to get active and lose weight. (Grade 10)

I've been training ~2-3 times a week since December, doing a couple 800,600,400,200m or so.

The only times I remember sadly are my 200m, I believe it was roughly around 32 seconds or so.

I had my first track meet 2 weeks ago and the only event available for me was the 1500m. I haven't done the 1500m before so I didn't really know what to expect. When the race begun, everyone's pace was very fast so I started to panic. I kept up in the middle of the group for the first 2 laps or so (the track was 200m) And I began to get tired and I was behind. Around 4 laps in, people started to lap me. I remember being really tired and I started slouching a little bit but I stiffened myself up after realizing. My breathing became very heavy but I tried to keep it in sync with my running. When there was half a lap left, I sprinted with as much energy as I had left but I couldn't keep it up and I basically slowed down the last 20m. My 1500m time was 6:37, that's not a good time but I want to do better. I want to try at least greeting to 5:50 or so. 
(I didn't get much sleep, I felt tired during the race and I also was hungry, I'll try to be in the best shape I can for my next meet)

Im asking for advice on how you'd handle the 1500m on a 200m track. And how you'd pace yourself and things like that. I didn't really know what to expect going into the 1500m. 

Also, I'd like to ask for advice on how you'd do the 800m, 400m & 200m as well, as that's the other events I had signed myself up for.

Thank you!",1647923113.0

Background 
Im 16 year old
5’9 
130 pounds
Here are my PR’s from last year (freshman year, first year of track for me) 
100m- 11.79
200m- 24.4
400m-55.0
I put a decent amount of off season work in, but the one thing I really am struggling with now that the season has started is what to eat, and when to eat it. Do I have a big breakfast before school, if so, what do I eat? Or do I pack snacks throughout the day, then have a giant dinner, any advice would help as i’m really trying to get faster. BTW, I take one scoop of protein powder a day and lift 30 minutes a day, not counting practice. I’m also considering starting creatine, but maybe that’s a separate issue. Anyways, any advice would be helpful!",1647827198.0

1600-3200; How Do I Improve?,2,ti3vpf,trackandfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/comments/ti3vpf/16003200_how_do_i_improve/,5,"This is probably the most asked question in all of track and field, but I am could use some guidance here. I am a freshman in high school at a 2A school in Texas, but I feel like my times should be faster. I run the 3200 and 1600 with times last meet of 11:12 and 5:14 respectively (from my only meet this year: [https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=15722774&L=0](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=15722774&L=0)) (2A life lol) but was really expecting faster times or a sub-5 especially after my hard work and [training schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Bi6w10O1Z6wXQiXuWNsn0cEusrrr4iSf7RngJ3bouI/edit?usp=sharing) this year, as well as pretty fast cross country times (18:32 at state meet in Nov.)

It could be that these 11:12 and 5:14 times are a bad example because the meet was pretty windy and I was a little bit sore from working out the other day, but even in practices my times are not where I want them to be. I don't think it is my diet, as I am not eating any unnatural sugars and kept a pretty natural diet even before I started doing that about a month ago. The only possibility for what is giving me these times is apparently my schedule.

Really the largest piece of this puzzle is probably my lack of coaching. The coach at my school right now does absolutely nothing and the team is responsible for their own workouts; I am fine with this, (as our team as a whole does not have a whole lot of talent, and means I get to make my own schedule) but I would definitely like someone to talk to as I feel I am entirely ""out of the loop"" on what to do. I mainly consult my biology teacher on this as he was a former cross country coach, but considering I have heard so much different opinions I thought I would turn to where the knowledge seems to be (i.e. Reddit).

I have heard everything from ""never lift weights if you do distance"" to ""do a really slow squat and you will improve"" but no matter what, I'm always pushing myself, so I don't think that is the issue. I know everyone is different and that it is really hard to generalize and recommend a workout for someone, but even just a ""hey, do more core workouts"" or ""hey, maybe try..."" would be very helpful.

Overall, I would like advice on my schedule and If possible, a reason I am not getting the times I want. I am 5' 11"" and weigh 140 lbs. I eat healthy, carb load before meets, push myself when practicing, don't eat protein powder or anything crazy like that and stretch before races. I understand genetics play a massive part in this and that most people just aren't built for a sub-5, but I think I am kind of alright in that field with my freshman cousin almost making it to the 6A state championships and a history of runners in my family.

Seems spikes are either 100-400 or 800-1500 and now with all these different carbon soles and whatnot its actually quite a difference between them.

I wanna buy 1 pair to rule them all (for now) and use both in training and competition. Both because of budget and just being safe and familiar with my shoe.

Lately a couple girls have started emphasizing going easier on easy days, which I understand. But for me an easy pace is like 7:00 to 7:30 ish, and they literally make everyone go at least 8:00. I’m talking like, everyone stays behind one girl “leader” or we have to get down and do push-ups. This is my first year, and I’m also about the same speed in races as them so it sounds super egotistical if I try and ask them to speed up, it’s just that I show up every day ready to push myself at least a little, but it turns into this annoying pace-policing resulting in me going way slower than feels good. The only runs I get to pace myself are the workouts 3x a week, which is fun but I’m super interested in improving, and idk if the other girls are as motivated. Does anyone have thoughts on this?

TL;DR my distance girls team forces everyone to go slow on easy runs to the point where it’s inefficient and feels like I have no autonomy.",1647582595.0

Trying out hurdling as a distance runner,1,tgu9yc,trackandfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/comments/tgu9yc/trying_out_hurdling_as_a_distance_runner/,4,"This is kind of long so look at bottom for summary.

Hi, I'm a male sophomore in HS and this is my first year doing xc/track. I started training last summer, at abt 35 mpw, but didn't really see results in the fall xc team, despite being the fastest on the team (I go to a very slow high school). I got really sick from the flu over the winter, missing the majority of the indoor season, and when I came back, my entire summer/fall aerobic base was gone. I'm now going into my first outdoor season (I think we start kind of late?) and am kind of sick of all the distance training, especially because our practices aren't long enough for proper mileage and with school its impossible for me to train during weekdays outside of practice. Additionally, we don't have a real training program and our workouts are kind of arbitrary. I have mostly been self training by reading books and letsrun forums. Historically speaking, the school has been stronger at sprints than long distance events, which matches up with the poor distance training.

Hence, I'm interested in trying other events besides distance (1000m+) and want to try out hurdling (400mH), which I think I might have more fun/success at. I don't have a lot of raw speed (100m) but my sprint endurance (400m) is pretty decent compared to the other sprinters. I also have always been good at technical things, which is why I'm interested in the 400mH. This season won't be competitive for me whether or not I do distance because I have no aerobic base. I also just really like watching hurdlers, always been a fan of the event and always thought that hurdlers are cool but have kind of locked myself into distance mentally. The only problem I'm seeing with switching to hurdles is that I don't know if theres anyone to actually coach me and correct form (I was just thinking of posting here like twice a month for help, on top of recording myself during practice and looking at online resources/books). Hence, I'm wondering if you guys think it would be fine to try out hurdling out for a month or so.

He thinks 400 runners should train as ""mid distance"" because they need endurance. I argue I can get them endurance training in a speed format. We have some kids that run both the 400 and 800, so I think that's where he's getting it from. 

Hear me out though... At meets here the 400 and 800 are basically right next to each other. So they are never going to do them both at a championship meet. Maybe 4x8 and 400, or 800 and 4x4. But I think they should train for either the 400 OR the 800 and if they can happen to also do well in the other with that training, that's a bonus. 

Any other coaches or athletes have an opinion? I feel like I'm right but don't we all... Open to hearing other views on it.

When to train for jumping Training?,2,tde93l,trackandfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/comments/tde93l/when_to_train_for_jumping_training/,0,"Edit: Title should say Jumping Strength

I don't do track and field, however I want to use the things I learned in College (Sportscience) for my Basketball training.

I Went trough the Scripts (and stuff) of my Track and Field Courses and basically what it says is:
Start Training for ""Jumping Strength"" (German: Sprungkraft - idk the correct english translation) about 8 weeks before a meet. 

Usually, we (learned to) structure our Programs into 12 or 16 weeks (3 or 4 phases).
Meaning, you wouldnt start doing jumping Training after 4 or 8 weeks.
Every Other aspect basically is to be Developed (or at least maintained) year round.
Examples: Sprint Training, Endurance (Middle Distance Running) and strength Training, including ""Throwing Strength""


Why is that?

The events he is going to do are the 100M sprint, high jump javelin. I really dont want to throw abunch of money at 1-3 diffrent types of shoes he will outgrow but i will if i need to because i want him to get used to the spikes he will be wearing if he chooses to continue to pursue track and field. I just want to make sure i am getting the right footwear before i buy. Also should he have like a universal shoe for his practices? I know he will be walking between grass, track, asphalt when practicing or is it ok to practice in the spikes that we will be purchasing for his events at the track meets? 

Sorry i am new to all this and i just want to give him the right spikes/shoes he needs to be competitive now and to build a solid foundation to build his skills on.

I think I could drop it to 56 high by the middle of outdoor. My 600m time is 1:35. I ran the mile time trial at the beginning of the season and my time was 5:15 and my 800m time trial was 2:18. My coach and I are still not sure which events I should do. I’m definitely going to stick with hurdles, but as for other events, do you think I should possibly start mid-distance, or stick to shorter sprinting?",1646946646.0

So from my understanding most schools, have track as the dominant spring sport, with people doing baseball only if they’re incredibly good at it. At my school however, that’s not the case. My freshman year we had only 19 kids doing it, sophomore year was missed due to Covid, junior year was 24. Now having been elected captain my junior year I found myself not wanting another small team I decided to some hardcore recruiting around the school and I’m happy to say...46 people are gonna be doing track :) this is nearly a 4th of the school (less than 200) another great thing is that we’ll actually have a solid girl team, as freshman year there were only 2, junior year there were 3 (two of which graduated that year), this year 20 girls have signed up to do track and 26 dudes (counting me) for an incredibly small school, that has a history of sidelining the track program (as so much of our track portions are not up to code, though with such a large amount of people the school has finally decided to update the track from broken tar to actual track material, level out the discus and shot area and to expand some other parts), and as a senior captain in his last year I couldn’t be happier for the future of our program.
Also time isn’t up yet and I’d love to get 4 more athletes so we have a 50 person roster XD",1646868364.0

i've recently started a podcast called something in the grey. we grew frustrated with the lack of nuance and depth with modern media and so ""something in the grey"" was born. we aim to go beyond the person in the limelight and the label people are thoughtlessly assigned to. we provide a platform for people to share their stories, control the narrative and enable the complexity of topics to be explored.

multi record holder, 3 time olympian and dual olympic finalist, genevieve is australia’s most accomplished middle-distance woman. she has, and continues to, overcome any and all obstacles on her way to success. she was honest and vulnerable, explaining the mental anguish she felt after injuring herself in the olympic final of the 3000 m steeplechase and the road to recovery.

I have competed in track all four years in high school. I enjoy it, but my focus has most been XC. Entering my final season, I really want to work hard and give it all I got.

In the fall I ran XC and my PR for a 5K was 16:40 and that was on about 30 miles a week. Last track season my PR for the mile was 4:49 and for the 2 mile 10:34 on about 25 miles a week. Both season I was doing usually two hard days a week with one being intervals and the other being hills. (I live in Montana so we've got plenty of hills).

Right now I'm running around 20 miles a week at a 7 minute pace with weight room workouts 5 days a week mostly comprised of squats and dead lift usually around 135 lbs for 10-15 reps with other exercises as well. For reference I am 5' 11"" and weigh 130 lbs.

I would greatly appreciate any advice that would help me achieve my goal whether it is in the weight room or out running. My season starts March 14th and my first meet is April 4th.

Thanks!",1646709083.0

Now I'm in college and I haven't been running much. Just the occasional long run. But I've kept going to the gym everyday. I'm about 6 foot 190 pounds right now and I have a pretty good build. But I'm considering trying out for the track team at my school. It's D3 so it shouldnt be too hard but when I do try out I don't want to just make the cut. I want to wow the coach. I've got a lot of free time to start getting into really good running shape. My main event is the 800 but I also ran the 400 and 1600. So should I be spending less time in the gym and more time running track workouts? Or if I can still lift in the gym should I switch to more endurance lifting rather than strength lifting? And what should be my goal bodyweight wise? I ran 2:01 800 my senior year of highschool and I was about 183 ish. Should I try and aim for even lighter then that to get a solid 800 time because my main goal is to break 2 minutes since I never got the chance to do it. And I guess my overall question is what should a guy like me who has hours of free time every day be doing to try and get into the best running shape possible.

When I was 14 (back in 2019) I had a time of 2:04 flat, which obviously isn’t terrible for a 14 year old. However, I haven’t really progressed much beyond this time. Last track season I ran a 2:01.1 in late April, and I never ran faster throughout May. I am curious why I have only dropped less than three seconds from my time. Is it normal to basically have a peak in physical development at 14?

Now, I should add something that might render this question unanswerable. For the past three years I have been entirely focused on soccer rather than track. So, I have never gone through a base phase for any track season, and all my training has solely started in April. I have never worked much on race strategy or form either(for example: last season I ran a race with splits 54.0/1:09.3. I have always just sort of sprinted to the finish). My lack of preparation or focused training may explain the lack of development over 3 years. But even then, I would have thought that basic development would have at least carried me past 2:00 mark last year.

So for context I ran xc (my first sport ever and my first running experience) my best time was an 18:44 at the end of the season. Pretty solid especially for me. Anyway track season rolled around and of course I want to do long distance. Today I prd the mile by 37 secs went from 6 flat to 5:23, and prd 2 mile by 50 secs, went from 12:30 to 11:40.


We have a sprint coach and a distance coach. When we did a time trial for the 800 the sprint coach told me that my first 100, and last 100m were really good and he would be interested in putting me in some relays of I stacked well against the other sprinters. Now, I really like sprinting I think it's really fun but idk if I would burn myself out too much. 


I talked to the sprint coach today and he said that we don't have good enough athletes for a solid 4x4. So he wants the distance guys to do 400 time trials as well as 100s. I'm 100% up for it I've even been doing some sprint drills after practice to try and maintain my decent sprint times. But my worry is that it will clash with distance.

Sprints are almost always ran before the 2 mile but after the mile, so that leaves me in a weird warmup cooldown loop. And the 4x4 so far has always been at the end. I'm worried that if I also did sprints I would do worse in long/mid and vice versa. Another problem is spikes

All the good sprinting spikes are sold out in my size (m8.5) and they are all kinda pricy. I wanted to get the adidas tokyo sprint spikes because of discount, but all sold out. I think right now my best choice is the asics metasprint tokyo spikes. And ima be honest they look kinda nice but the 180 price tag makes it hard for me to get. The money isn't the problem, I'm willing to spend it the problem is my mom. She says that the shoes aren't needed and that a good runner will run good in any shoe. She doesn't even want to let me get new 90 dollar trainers so convincing her may be tough. Would running in my distance spikes put me at a disadvantage during meets?

I’ve never run the 800 before, ever. I’m used to running distance, but i’m certainly not great at distance running either.
My goal for my first meet is just to finish the race, just finish and hope I don’t get last.

I see this topic come up frequently and wrote a (lengthy) blog post a few years back regarding running in college, recruitment process, and considerations for HS athletes. It still seems relevant now so I've provided the text version below. Some info may be slightly dated but as a former D1 XC runner, NCAA qualifier, and HS/college coach, I wanted to provide some information. This is just my opinion and happy to have others weigh in on their thoughts as well. Please also feel free to reach out if you have any questions as I know it can be daunting.

(Note: Mods, I have not linked to my blog/site. Any links provided were references used in the blog from NCAA and such. If those aren't permitted - please feel free to remove).

\--------------------------------------------

Many athletes want to consider whether or not competing in college is an option for them, but don’t know where to begin. I wanted to put together a detailed breakdown so you know exactly what to expect if you wish to pursue athletic competition for Cross Country or Distance Running in college.

To start, the most important thing is finding a college that fits you. Put your academics and own self growth above competing at a University. If you broke your leg the first week on campus, would you still be happy with your choice? Things to consider when looking at the mass amount of colleges:

⁃ In-State vs Out of State

⁃ Do you want to live in a big city or small town?

⁃ Major University vs Small School

⁃ Private vs Public

⁃ Admissions Standards

⁃ Cost of Tuition 

⁃ Financial Aid packages offered.

⁃ Majors/Departments (Do they offer what you want to study?)

⁃ Alumni Network

You can find all of this information for schools at websites like [www.PrincetonReview.com.](http://www.princetonreview.com./) In addition to the items listed above, it also includes acceptance rates, breakdown of GPA, 25-75th percentile ACT/SAT, Cost of tuition, average financial aid package, etc. It’s never too early to start reviewing what schools interest you. If you’re traveling you may want to stop and visit a prospective schools as you’re passing through.

**Understanding Collegiate Athletics:** 

The primary association of collegiate sports is the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). There are three tiers of competition within this organization:

Division 1: 

• Largest universities and the overall highest level of collegiate athletics. 

• The majority of state and large universities are Division 1.

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track & Field and 18.0 for women XC/Track & Field. 

• Majority of schools have a Track & Field Program

• Note: Schools in the Ivy League (Harvard, Brown, etc) do NOT offer any athletic scholarship.

• Example D1 Schools: Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Clemson, Texas, Harvard, South Carolina, Tennessee, Baylor, Stanford, 

Division 2: 

• Smaller schools and generally less known

• Overall less competitive than Division 1

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track & Field and 12.6 athletic scholarship for women’s XC/Track & Field. 

• Usually have smaller rosters than D1 thus easier to receive scholarship.

• Includes mostly private schools so tuition may be higher.

• Many do not have a Track & Field Program.

Division 3:

• Small schools and generally private

• No athletic scholarships 

• D3 schools can be just as competitive as Division 2 despite no athletic scholarship. This is due to several more prestigious schools being D3 such as Johns Hopkins, MIT, NYU, and Carnegie Mellon. Athletes may use their ability to assist them gaining admission into the school.

• On average have larger team size than D2

• Example Schools: Johns Hopkins, Haverford, Geneseo Street, Calvin, St. Lawrence, Wisconsin Platteville, Wisconsin Stevens Point, Dickinson, Washington-St. Louis, New York University, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, 

&#x200B;

There are also some other organizations that offer athletics. This includes:

NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics): 

• Smaller 4-year colleges

• Less strict requirements to compete.

• There are equally talented players in the NAIA and NCAA D2 schools

NJCAA (Junior College):

• Junior/2-year colleges

• Small Team sizes

• Can offer athletic scholarship.

• Very loose requirements to compete. For example, any student may compete as long as they have not previously competed in intercollegiate competition. Technically, even parents could compete for these schools if they attended them.

• Generally used as a stepping stone. Athletes will often attend Junior College (JUCO) to improve grades before attending a 4-year university. It’s is a good way to save a lot of money by getting your Associates Degree (AA) before receiving your Bachelors at a 4-year University.

**Scholarship Information** 

Only 7.0% for male high school XC athletes and 8.6% for female high school XC athletes will compete at the varsity collegiate level. Only 1.8% of male XC athletes and 2.5% of female XC athletes will compete at the highest level (NCAA Division 1). While the odds may seem tough, it’s certainly not impossible if it’s something you wish to do as there are many different levels.

People tend to think all athletic scholarships as only “full ride” (full scholarship) or “walk on” (no athletic scholarship). In Cross Country/Track & Field, D1/D2 schools are limited as to how much athletic scholarship they can give out while D3 offers no athletic scholarships. D1, for example, only has 12.6 male scholarships and 18.0 female scholarships to field both their XC and Track & Field rosters. If you consider this is generally broken up into 4 years, there is usually only about 3-4 full scholarships available for each genders incoming freshman class. This is to fund an entire Cross Country/Track & Field team which can be as many as 50-60 athletes. In short, a full athletic scholarship is extremely rare in XC/Track & Field and scholarships are generally broken up into many partial scholarships (15%, 20% etc).

Instead of looking towards a rare athletic full ride, you need to consider the entire financial package. After all, you may still end up with a very good portion of your college being paid. Things outside of athletic scholarship to consider are:

⁃ Academic Aid

⁃ Grants

⁃ Need based Aid

⁃ Outside Scholarships

⁃ Florida Bright Futures (or similar in-state programs)

⁃ In-State vs Out of State Tuition (i.e: UF tuition is $6,381 per year for Florida residents while it’s $28,658 for out-of-state students)

⁃ Public vs Private (Private schools can get VERY expensive but often offer better academic aid packages to bring the cost down).

So overall, athletic aid is just a portion of your financial consideration. If you were to get a partial scholarship you may receive other grants, academic scholarships, and need based scholarships that covers the majority of your tuition.

**Standards for Competing in College:**

There is a wide variety of athletes that compete across all divisions in college. Here is a very general breakdown of the average athlete in each division. Note: Coaches will not always consider your XC time because courses and conditions can be so different. Just because you run a specific time on one occasion doesn’t mean you meet a specific programs requirement. Similarly, if you don’t run one of the specified times below, it doesn’t automatically disqualify you from every program in that division. I have also included a breakdown of track mid-distance to distance times. The track times listed are aggressive/faster as they are the range for an athletic scholarship requirement for each division. 

Once again, if you don’t have those exact times, it by no means disqualifies you as there is a wide variety of teams/programs in each division with different standards and depends on whether or not you are looking towards athletic scholarship. The best thing you can do is contact a schools coach to see exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a very broad breakdown of the type fo athletes schools in each division is looking from, as seen on: [http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:](http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:)

**How & When To Begin The Recruiting Process:** 

Division 1 and Division 2 coaches are not permitted to call or email you prior to the start of your Junior Year. 

Division 3 coaches can contact you as a junior in high school.

The recruiting process is generally straight forward in cross country (and track & field) compared to some sports. For example, in many team sports, you are expected to attend specific tournaments, send game film of yourself, attend camps, etc. The college coaches need to see you play (often several times) in order to determine if you are the right fit for their team. In addition to this, there are many variables such as the quality of the opponent, quality of your own team, etc. It can be a challenge to set yourself apart - especially at the highest level.

For cross country and track & field it is quite a bit simpler. You can let your times and/or finishes at the state meet do the talking for you. Track times for distance events, as well as XC times, can be sent to the coach and they will have a solid understanding of your ability. In fact, many college teams will even list specific time standards they are looking for.

Generally, it falls on you as an athlete to make the first move. The ideal scenario is as follows:

• Create a list of 5-10 schools (or more) that interest you. 

• Visit the cross country and/or track & field section of their athletic website

• See if they have time standards to make their team. If not, look through their roster, last years’ results to try get an idea of the general range they are looking for. If a team is comprised of all athletes who ran a 16:00 5k or faster in high school, there’s no point wasting your time if you’ve only run 18:30 for 5k.

• Go to PrincetonReview.com to see if you are a good fit for the school academically, financially, etc. 

• If you align with a school academically, athletically, financially, then fill out the Cross Country or Track & Field Recruiting questionnaire. Most schools will have this listed, but if there is no questionnaire then email the coach directly. Write a personalized email - no generic templates.

• Get certified by the NCAA Eligibility Center ([https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):](https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):) REQUIRED for official visits or to sign a National letter of intent.

If your XC/Track & Field times, GPA, SAT/ACT Scores interest the coach, they may call you and begin the recruiting process. Recruiting services are a rip-off for cross country and a waste of time. Everything can and should be done by yourself. I can also help in any way possible, although I often just look through the teams website and school info on Princeton review to create a breakdown like below (something you can certainly do by yourself as well):

University of South Florida

⁃ Enrollment: 48,793 

⁃ 47% acceptance rate

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Reading: 530-620

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Math: 540-630

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Writing: 510-600 

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile ACT: 24-28 

⁃ In-State Tuition - $6,336/Year

⁃ On Campus Room & Board: $9,700

⁃ NCAA Division 1

⁃ Wide range of athletes, but girls HS 5k PRs generally range from 20:30-21:00. 

⁃ You can see their 2016 results here: [http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578](http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578)

⁃ Recruiting Questionnaire: [https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&SPORTID=58](https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&SPORTID=58)

⁃ Does have a track & field team

You may receive letters in the mail. This is often a mailing blast sent to hundreds of athletes. You still need to fill out the questionnaire or email the coach to continue the recruiting process.

**Continuing Communication:**

When contacting coaches, they want to hear from YOU - not your parents and not your coaches. Ultimately, you are the one that will be attending the school so you should be the one communicating with them. If they want to talk with your parents or coaches, they will certainly find a way to do so.

When making the initial contact with the coach, you have to realize they may be hearing from hundreds of athletes. Keep the email concise and list your PRs, State Meet Finishes, and GPA/Test Scores. Coaches don't have time to read a long-winded email about your work ethic and being vice president of the key club. Consider your email like a resume: keep it short and quickly detail your accomplishments within a paragraph of two.

If a coach calls you on the phone, they have a certain degree of interest in you. Do not be afraid to ask questions! They will often dictate the conversations but may ask questions about your training (how many miles you run), upcoming races, what you’re looking for in a school, etc. Sometimes athletes get nervous or the phone call doesn’t go as planned. If you have spoken to a coach, it doesn’t hurt to reach out to them and reiterate your interest, ask any questions you may have forgotten, and continue the conversation. Remember, they will be contacting MANY athletes.

If you have no interest in the school whatsoever, let the coach know. Maybe the school is out of state while you’re certain you want to stay in-state. It may be a different division than you want to compete in. Whatever the reason, if you’re certain you don’t want to attend their school there is no point wasting both of your time. Let them know. They won't take it personally and will simply move onto the next athlete.

After several phone calls, a coach may invite you to attend the school on an “official visit”.  This is an all expenses paid visit to the school where they will show you the campus, introduce you to the team, coaches, training staff, academic advisors, etc. In short, it’s an extended campus visit that the school pays for. You are only permitted to take 5 official visits.

Alternatively, they may ask you to come visit “unofficially”. This may apply if you’re racing at the school during a weekend and they just want to meet you face to face.

During the entire recruiting process and even now, it’s important you are careful what you post on social media. Just as you are considering the school as a complete package, the coach is considering you in the same way. Coaches will often look through your social media accounts to see if you are the type of athlete and person that’s right for their program. Posting ridiculous things on your Twitter, Instagram, etc could cost you scholarship money or even a spot on a team you are interested in.

Between NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, there are over 1,200 men’s XC programs and over 1,300 women’s XC program. If competing in college is something you aspire to do, work on getting your times down and find the program that fits you best. Above all, find the school that suits you and where you can see yourself growing academically and as a person.

**Quotes from college coaches themselves** (from athleticscholarships.com):

As stated by Florida State’s head coach Bob Braman:

“It's very important for high school athletes to understand that our sport is very objective and that times, distances, etc. can be measured against other athletes all over the world.  The reality is major college programs like ours will not recruit athletes with “untapped potential”.  We want the best of the best and then we’ll separate them based on coaching , competition, etc.

Always look on the universities’ athletic webpage and see if they list scholarship standards.  Even if they don’t be sure to only contact those that fit your talents. Always send a personalized e-mail to either the head coach or event coach.  In the e-mail you should include best performances / marks and SAT/ACT/GPA information.

Biggest misconception is that we’re like Football.  Track and Field is limited to 12.6 scholarships for men and 18 scholarships for women.  With 19 events plus cross country to cover that means that full scholarships are extremely rare”

The head coach, Brenden Rickert, from D1 school Fairfield University (in Connecticut), states:

“Know the school you're applying to - don't write a generic email to every coach. Look at the times and/or performances of athletes currently on the roster to see how you compare. If you're way off, chances are you will not be on the team.

Don't use a recruiting service - times and performances don't lie so we do not need to see a video of you running. Do not give us times that cannot be found on a legitimate website, we will assume they are wrong.  Fairfield University

Update 1-2 times per week. There's dozens of you and only a couple coaches, so the more you update the more you're on our radar. Prepare and ask questions- we want you to make the best decision for you. Let the coach know if you're no longer interested in the school.

Enjoy the process, it's a whirlwind but if you do it right, you'll have some amazing experiences that you'll remember for the rest of your life.”

8x3 on 2 off fartlek then 4x200 with 200 jogging rest:
5:10-5:15 on, up and down some hills. 200s in 31 roughly. Felt smooth. Could have done like 4 more fartlek reps pretty easily. Probably should have gone faster.

300/400/600/800/600/400/300 ladder: 2-2:30 min rest between all reps except for after the 800 when we got 4 min. 48/68/1:43/2:20/1:44/67/47. No drop off. Also felt fairly easy as well. Lungs hurt a bit but legs didn’t really. Could’ve done on less rest. 

6x312s with 3 min rest:
300 fast 100 jog slow (35-40sec) 200 fast then rest
300s all in 45, did not fall off although they were all very very hard
200s in 30-32, fell off slightly near the end,
3 minutes between every rep. 
Felt very hard. I don’t think I could’ve done one more without falling off 2+ seconds

3x4x200:
30-45 sec between reps 5 min between sets.  30 29 29 29 for the first 4 then 27 30 29 30 then 30 31 30 31. Hit the lactic wall near the end. Hurt very bad. Probably could have done more physically (didn’t think I could do another set after the second) but mentally no way.

Should I transfer?,33,tgnu1x,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/tgnu1x/should_i_transfer/,6,"Alright so I’m currently a 1st year D2 runner. I finished up Cross season and can’t say I really loved it. There’s no team environment here and the coaching isn’t very beneficial. The team came in from the summer extremely out of shape and they tend to be lazy. Because of this my passion for running and work ethic has slowly dwindled. I’m thinking about transferring to my hometowns school, however they’re D1 and I know I’m not hitting the times to run D1. But they have an amazing coach, and amazing team environment. (I know a couple of the runners there) I’m really debating if I should transfer, a big portion holding me back is my coach kicked off a few of my teammates and essentially has a whole new team coming in, which makes me want to see what that would be like. (and not to mention I don’t really love the town my college is in either). I just am hesitant because I don’t know if I’m jumping ship too early as my original plan was to at least stay for 2 years in order to give it enough time.

I didn't think too much about it, I could care less, I was just addicted to running. 

Slowly over time though, my body began to deteriorate, and I started noticing a lot of issues. I still ran, but took it more easily, and started to look into my issues a lot more. Then when my last Cross Country season started ending (around October), I just gave up, and stopped running. 

I figured it would be best to just rest my body until December, and start running by then to get ready for Track season. However it didn't go away at all, and now I've told my coach that I'm not going to be able to do Track. Sucks, but at this point I know there's no point in doing Track if it's going to make my legs worse.

I did run once back in January, because I thought maybe it would help if I took a jog since I hadn't ran in so long. However once I got done, my legs were throbbing. It's frustrating because it was a slow, 30 minute run. Yet I was still in a lot of pain, when I could've ran it with ease a year ago.

I really don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has any advice that could help to heal this, I appreciate it. I fucked up, and now I'm facing the consequences.

Today was our first meet of the season. Both boys were registered for the middle school mile. For John, the goal was to break 6 minutes in the mile. For Tyler, we were looking to record a good time to get a baseline for his current fitness.

Most of the work I've had the two of them do is form work. Often doing the drill routine 3x, followed by a hard 200 after each set of drills. B/c John swims competitively and has practice a few times a week we have to be extra thourough with the warm-up and drill routine due to tight hamstrings. We've started doing 10-15 minutes of foam rolling before practices. On Thursday we did 2x10 minutes @ mile effort of in and outs on the infield of the track. This was to get some leg turnover on a soft surface.

John hit his goal of sub 6 by running a 5:55. What's more impressive is how he did it, which you can see in the link below. Tyler ran 6:33. Not quite as fast as I was hoping but this was his first track meet.

To my surprise I was able to casually run a 5k non stop pretty easily. I am sweating buckets, but my heart rate never went too high and I felt like I could definitely go further if I wanted to.

The reason I am sharing this is because I don't think I would have been able to run as much as I did if it weren't for competing in XC races like I did when I was younger.

Slowest D1 schools by Region,16,slivx1,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/slivx1/slowest_d1_schools_by_region/,15,"A few months ago I put together a list of the slowest D1 schools by conference. You can check that out here: [Slowest D1 Schools by Conference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHHCRrhol7g6AEGCC6Lwsyn1pFYn4vrC0jo0kkTzojU/edit#gid=0)

While the conference spreadsheet wasn't bad, it wasn't the best measure of ability either due to some conferences running different distances. This was more true for the women with half of the conferences running 5k and the other half running 6k. I also did not account for altitude in some of the conferences.

This new spreadsheet is a much better measure of ability due to the uniformity of distances at all races. Had to account for elevation in one region. The standards I used for ""slow"" were 31:00 for 10k and 21:00 for 6k. Keep in mind these times are team averages.

[Slowest D1 Schools by Region](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0EgUxgXKoGdqdoKIDEF75wOlI8gaxye94_Epqsnqnk/edit?usp=sharing) 

Athletes using these spreadsheets to see where they could potentially run in D1 need to keep a few things in mind

1) What do you want to study?

2) How much is going to school going to cost?

3) What is the maximum distance you're willing to travel and be away from home?

4) Which schools have teams you can contribute to based on the criteria above?

I'm feeling like my body doesn't want to run anymore.,22,sf14fv,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/sf14fv/im_feeling_like_my_body_doesnt_want_to_run_anymore/,5,"I'm writing this post out of frustration and hopelessness about running has been feeling lately.

I feel like I improved throughout high school in running and was best my senior year (especially in track) without changing my training that much. However my freshman year of college, I PR'd in the 5k, so technically I was still improving. My last effort I was happy with was a 2 mile track time trial in November. After that, I feel like everything went downhill (or uphill should I say?). I took a week off to prepare for indoor track training and then when I came back to running, I was injured, so I had to take about a month of. I cross trained for a week and a half, but basically did nothing for 2 weeks.

I've been attempting to run since then. Luckily, I'm pain free in that injury location. It's just my legs feel very heavy, when running and climbing stairs. I've probably put on 5 pounds from where I'd like to be (I'm 5'3"" and 133), but I don't know if that's it, because I PR'd weighing 131. I have no energy on my runs unless I go at a 9:30-10:00/mi pace and I've had to drop out of every single workout so far which has been discouraging to say the least.

Last winter I was running half marathons at 7:40/mi paces with massive negative splits, running a 10k in 45 mins and just feeling great, low heart rate, etc. Now it's like I go out for a 4 mile run in the 8:50 range and have to stop 4 times and just feel like I'm dragging myself through the run.

My PR in the mile is 5:43 (spring 2021) and now I feel like getting under 7 right now would be a struggle. My 5k PR is 20:4x (was actually during a 6k race) but I doubt I could go much faster than 23 right now.

My coach suggested getting tested for anemia, but I don't think that's it. I think I'm just not getting enough sleep, got out of shape, and just can't come back. In the back of my mind, I'm worried that my body has changed and that I'll never get back in shape at all, which I know might be a possibility. I want to be a lifelong runner, but I'd still love to compete in college, but now things are looking bleak.

Before I used to barely run over the winter/summer at all and come back and be in fine shape for cross country. Even just last spring, I basically went right from being injured to PRing in the mile. I'm just losing patience.

Does anyone have any insight on what could have happened? Is it just natural for me to be slowing down as I get older? Thanks.",1643404992.0

Something I have seen frequently both in-person and on /r/crosscountry are posts about a loss of fitness after taking an extended break after cross country. 

This reminds me of a friend I had who started going on a diet to try and lose 100lbs. 

My friend would stick to their diet for two days, then take five days off. After doing this for two months, he was frustrated that he wasn't losing weight as fast or consistently at all - in fact his weight didn't change!

The posts and conversations I've had recently remind me of this friend. Without consistent, focused effort, it can be near impossible to improve on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. 

The sooner you can maintain a running, strengthening, and mental practice routine, the sooner your running will improve. Now, this can be hard at first - working together with your teammates can help. 

To finish, imagine if you’re a freshman or younger and plan on running throughout high school.

How much faster would your senior year self be if you could maintain consistent running, strengthening, and mental training 45-48 weeks per year?

Should my son do cross country in high school?,64,rumudc,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/rumudc/should_my_son_do_cross_country_in_high_school/,93,"My son is 13 and in 8th grade. He is very thin, but tends to do well in athletic type things if he tries. The problem is he doesn't like competition and he has a lot of anxiety. P.E. has been miserable for him this year because kids pick on him. He doesn't want to do PE in high school, so he's considering trying out for a sport. He would also like a way to make some friends. The cross country team doesn't cut and I've heard that kids on cross country teams tend to be very nice and supportive.

Right now he can't even run a mile without stopping. We did a walk/run for 2 miles and it was about 22 minutes. So I know he is not currently in shape for cross country. Do you think it would be unreasonable (or embarrassing, which he is worried about) to go out for cross country? 

If you are on the team, it is also considered a class, so you can't just drop out if you don't like it. And we have to decide his schedule for next year soon. Would this be too hard of a sport for an out-of-shape kid with tons of anxiety?",1641166669.0

Do college coaches check Strava?,49,rrkzcl,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/rrkzcl/do_college_coaches_check_strava/,11,"Hey, all I have a question that just crossed my mind today. Here’s a scenario. Say that a high school runner emails a college coach, and all of their times just meet the standards for the college. But this runner has a public Strava account, where it is documented that he runs ~100 mpw. Obviously that’s a lot for a high schooler, and the coach may be tentative to have him on the team. Now another runner with the same times emails the coach, but does not use Strava, so the coach assumes his mileage is less. The coach chooses this second person to make his team. Now this may be very oversimplified, but does stuff like this happen? Can it be bad to use Strava when trying to be recruited by colleges? I appreciate any input.",1640817644.0

Slowest D1 schools by pace,35,rcp748,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/rcp748/slowest_d1_schools_by_pace/,13,"I've been working on a spreadsheet that shows the slowest D1 schools by conference. For the men, I set a standard that 25:00 for 8k would be considered slow. For the women I felt like I couldn't set a hard standard b/c some conferences had their women race 6k and others 5k but still tried to maintain some consistency with who and what I picked. In some instances I put the entire conference into a column b/c they didn't meet the standard I set for fast. Some teams probably shouldn't be on this list b/c of how they ran their conference meet i.e. both Furman teams scored 15 at their conference meet which tells me they weren't racing very hard that day due to their conference being very weak.

Some conferences are just weak but that is likely due to their school's being more academically focused and that is ok. That's how school should be. Some schools may not recruit with the full amount of scholarships they're allowed to recruit with. This list was made for those of you with D1 aspirations so you can see where you might fit based on current times and paces and leverage your abilities to get good financial aid packages. Someone running 5:20 for a 5k isn't going to get money to run at NAU but could get money to run at Northern Colorado. D1 isn't the end all be all of collegiate running. D2 and D3 are valid options depending on your needs and desires.

So after XC we were on a 2-week break and since I remembered from last year how slow I was speed-wise, I did a few exercises that were apparently supposed to help with speed or something, but it was probably too much at once and hurt my knees.

I went to a doctor and they said it is an inflamed area below my knee where apparently (I don't remember exactly lol) two part of the bone/growth plate have created a gap which is naturally because I'm growing, but these exercises put some stress on it so it hurts when I run.

20 days of training had gone by and it was time to run, scared but I kept telling myself that running is only partly physical and mostly mental. The hardest day was Day 1 where I almost didn't get up at Mile 26, I still don't know how but I got up after laying in the street for 45 min in 28 degree weather and walked 2 and ran to my rest stop. It is because of this journey that I have begun to truly find myself. Ultra is the answer I didn't know I was looking for, but, it is far from over I still have 7 days to go!

I guess I've reached the end,39,qpt5qr,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qpt5qr/i_guess_ive_reached_the_end/,5,"Two days ago, was my senior state race. My team came in third, but I'm fine with that, after all, once you're a senior, a state loss becomes spilt milk. Anyway, yeah, I guess my cross-country career might be over, I might run in college, but at the moment, I don't know. Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's been a ride, and I wouldn't trade my time on the Hatton High School for anything. I've met many friends on this team (about half of which are still on the team now that I'm gone, so I'll definitely be showing up as a spectator next season a time or two) and they're all amazing people, and that even includes the one who became some sort of mystic conspiracy theorist sometime around or after college. 

Now that everything is said and done, I'm at liberty to commit a little bit of wrong-think and say something my teammates may not take so kindly to. If there are any runners from Cold Springs or Bayshore reading this, congratulations on 2nd and 1rst place in the 2A Alabama state race respectively, to any other seniors of their teams, I hope we can see each other not as foes, but as comrades, and feel free to message me, I'd love to open up communication, you may know me as Chase Rose, or, more likely, that one Hatton runner with the long hair and the small beard.  

Finally, a quick reflection on my career. It's not inaccurate to say that I was something of a mediocre runner, my final PR is 19:59 (yay, I finally got into the 19s, only took 3 years). Was I afraid of pain? Not gonna lie, if I had more tolerance of it, I probably would be much farther up there. Speculation aside, I am what I am, and maybe it's the whole being-part-of-a-relatively-elite-team that makes me seem slow by comparison. I've seen every year that at least one, but often more, of the new recruits would eventually pass me, and it was this year that one of those recruits from my 9th grade year managed to outdo me, so alongside those other teams from before, I'd like to congratulate him, if by any chance he uses this sub, I wish you a very pleasant fall in a ditch, and also want to say thanks for the memories as both my teammate and best friend.

Well, before I procrastinate what I was doing at that moment into oblivion, if this does happen to be the end of me as a cross country runner, then I'd like to say goodbye to this sub and its people, and goodbye to this ""absurd pastime"" as good ole' Bowerman put it.",1636423373.0

Anyways I Pr’d again at the end of October when I clocked in at 21:59 and came in third place (my second medal).

I have Winter Track coming up in a month, and I’m heavily debating to quit. I’ve gone into my story in detail so I’m just going to be quick about it now. I’ve had 3 stress fractures, 1 on my lower left back and 2 on my right fibula. I’ve also had 2 surgeries that were unrelated to running but set me back in my fitness. I’ve also had 2 ankle sprains, and multiple stress reactions in my feet. I have also dealt with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis. All of these injuries I have dealt with in the past three years. I’ve been to so many physical therapy sessions for each injury as well as many different doctors, but I can’t seem to get a break from these injuries. 

I missed my entire freshman year, and was finally able to run my sophomore year. I had a pretty good sophomore year when it came to running. I was most proud of my mile time, which was 5:05 that I ran during Winter track. I missed my sophomore spring track season due to an emergency surgery, and I ran only a couple races during my junior year and was a lot slower since I was running through injury. 

During the summer of my junior year going into senior year I got a second stress fracture on my fibula. I just recently recovered from that stress fracture and after weeks of PT I was cleared to run again. I had my first race in cross country about 2 months ago which was a 4K. I ran such a slow time, even during recovery days I run faster then what I ran. Also, after the run my fibula, which I had two stress fractures on, STILL hurts. I spoke to my doctor and I ended up having to quit the team. 

I have Winter Track coming up soon, and even though I’m not in much pain this instant I haven’t been running since every time I do fibula flares up. I’m just so disappointed and I honestly just want to quit. I don’t know what it is with me, I’ve gotten my running form analyzed, I’ve even been to a chiropractor. I just can’t seem to get a break from injury and it’s honestly making me hate running. 

I’ve already decided that in college if I run I want it to be STRICTLY casual, probably something like a club team so college recruiting shouldn’t be an issue. If I do quit, I won’t waste my time. I’ll probably get a part time job and start going to the gym, but then again this is my last opportunity to run for my school. Any advice would be appreciated.",1636303448.0

For some reason, in a recent meet, I performed way below my expectations (barely broke 18) even though other teammates I tend to run with got into the 17:30s, 20s, even lower. Let's just say this was a on a flat course-- Oak Ridge Park or Greystone, let's say. I basically just repeated my old PR in the 17:50s at the same course which was disappointing.

I think if I really pushed it though maybe I could have gotten into the 17:20s? I don't know why I had this mindset of barely pushing myself, and the race went so fast that I never had time to catch up when I should have.

Now, I ran similarly bad at Holmdel a while back-- 18:30s. But that was similar-- I went way too slow and had too much energy at the end! I didn't go fast enough.

Based on all this info, do you think I could get 17:30 at Holmdel in the coming weeks? If not, what is a realistic goal that will still push me hard?",1636244265.0

I was wondering if I could cut my time and possibly have times like the girls that got to go to states.

This was my first year of cross country, and I really loved it. I was planning to work in the offseason by building my endurance. I was planning to do:

M- 3/4 miles

T- Speed Workout

W- Easy Run

T- Long Run

F- Easy Run

S- Speed Workout

S- Cross Train/ Active Rest

And then if I need more rest, I will maybe take a week off or a couple of days off every so often.

Is this a good way to become faster? Is there something I should fix? Any advice or comments are appreciated, thank you!",1636201651.0

My daughter picked up cross country.  She did well enough and is looking to train more for next year, and plans to do track as well.

So, winter training.

What are the best methods folks have found for tracking indoor/outdoor track training sessions?  She has an Apple Watch, and I'd be interesting in getting a Garmin or going with a Stryd.

The goal is to make sure her effort is tracked in a way that can make sure she's not overworking, and I know the HRMs and footpods can help with that.  (We didn't have that when I did track and cross country, and I know myself and my teammates suffered in part because of it.)

Any advice is appreciated, even if the advice is ""just keep a list of times with a stop watch.""

How scholarships for XC and track work,74,ql9l0h,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/ql9l0h/how_scholarships_for_xc_and_track_work/,24,"I've found over the years not many people understand how recruiting for XC and track works. Most schools recruit with a certain number of scholarships. If a school's tuition is $30,000 a year, then 1 full ride scholarship is $30,000. Athletics programs have to work within their school's budget and their conference's scholarship limit. Some conferences allow schools to recruit with 5 or more scholarships and other conferences limit their schools to 3. It just depends on what the conference allows. Coaches can and will divide their scholarship money across a number of athletes. 

If you're looking to run somewhere and you're in the low 17s to mid 16s, there are some schools that will pay you well to run for them. Even 18 min guys can find scholarship money somewhere. I was a mid to low 16 guy in high school and had 75% of my education paid for at a D2 school, Mars Hill University in North Carolina. The team isn't as good as it once was and that means runners who wouldn't be invited to walk on at faster schools can get good money there. This is true for many schools.

Strength Training for XC,26,qke85s,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qke85s/strength_training_for_xc/,7,"Many distance runners avoid the weight room under the assumption lifting will lead to an increase in muscle mass that will slow them down. I believed this in high school and did body weight workouts. Avoiding the weight room was my first mistake. The second was focusing my strength training exclusively on upper body, believing all the running took care of my lower body strength.

Running is a complex movement people take for granted b/c we have been running since childhood. We use our calves, quads, hamstrings, and glutes through a series of muscle contractions and relaxing to push ourselves forward. Its important to strength train muscle groups together and just as important to work them in isolation. Strengthening these muscles will go a long way towards preventing injuries and add a layer of explosiveness to your running ability.

Its also important to strength train your upper body to improve general athleticism and efficiency of blood flow through the various muscle groups. Hypertrophy, gaining of muscle mass, can be prevented with properly building mileage to 40+ miles a week. At that level the body goes catabolic (burns muscle for fuel). I don't recommend building to 40 miles a week until freshman year of high school as bodies are still developing and even then its still more of a guideline than hardcore rule. You have to do what feels good for you. You also don't know what feels bad unless you push yourself to a higher level. Its a very delicate balancing act.

Great lower body workouts include squats, hip thrusts, calf raises, lunges, hamstring curls, and resistance band workouts.",1635774049.0
Who I am,6,qkk239,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qkk239/who_i_am/,9,"I've been sharing a lot of general advice and getting good feedback. 

I'm a former NCAA Division 2 XC and track athlete. I ran for a small school in NC called Mars Hill in the South Atlantic Conference. I ran there 2007-2011. While there I ran my school's 3rd fastest XC 10k in 32:09, competed at Division 2 Nationals 3x, and was All-Conference all four years including All-Freshman team in 07. 

Looking back, I didn't have a working knowledge of training principles in high school nor an appropriate understanding of how recruiting for college athletics works. I didn't know how to look for schools that might be a good fit for me. I assumed I would run my times and coaches would let me know if they were interested. I didn't know anything about recruiting questionnaires. In high school I was a big fish in a small pond with no concept of what I needed to do to compete at the level I wanted.

My goal here is to share what I've learned through my experiences so younger runners can maximize their potential and get some money for school if that is what they want. I am a USATF certified coach and work with adults and high school runners.

The next level,10,qjblgg,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qjblgg/the_next_level/,1,"Cross Country isn't super popular in South Carolina, where I coach. Not sure how much kids know in other states, but very few here are aware that college xc races are 6k for the women and 8k/10k for the men. 

For the high school juniors and seniors thinking about the next level, know that your races will be longer. Talk with your coach, or a coach, about getting ready for that type of running. 

As a coach, my advice is you build up your mileage to at least 60 a week as seniors just for the strength. Start a good strength routine for glutes, hips, and hamstrings.",1635631130.0

State meet mentality help,17,qhzw42,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qhzw42/state_meet_mentality_help/,6,"This might be kind of long but any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm a junior girl and I have my state meet in 2 days on Saturday, and I'm really nervous. I was in great shape at the start of the season, but then I got injured in September. I've been cleared to run for about 2 and a half weeks. I got to do 2 meets, but my fastest time was only around 22:15. I'm hoping to run low 21's (or under) on Saturday, but I know it's kind of a long shot. One thing that makes me more hopeful is that the 2 races I did were in about 75-80 degree weather, and it's supposed to be about 55-60 this weekend.

Something I always struggle about is my mentality during races. I know that I need to push, and that it should be hard, but race brain doesn't want to cooperate. I always start thinking, maybe I could just quit, just stop running. I've never let myself do that, and I only walked once, during 7th grade. So instead my brain switches to, okay as long as you finish it's fine, it doesn't matter if she passes you. I don't feel like I'm racing anymore, just finishing. Then as soon as I finish I know that I could have pushed a little harder and I get mad at myself. Does anyone have any tips to keep pushing when you want to stop or slow down? 

I'm just really nervous because I haven't even run my goal pace for 2 miles since I got injured and I don't know if I can even do it. I know that if my mentality was better I would do so much better during races. Any tips, mantras, pre-race things, whatever would be really helpful! Thanks in advance haha",1635465394.0

Sometimes it’s hard to balance athletics and school, but that’s not the point.

I just finished up cross country season with a pr of 22:38. Not great but I’m actually a sprinter in track though, last season in 8th grade I ran a 12:20 100 meter, 26:16 200m, and was 13th in the state for 400m with 58:56. I did very well in the 400 for only running it twice.  My coach convinced me to try out cross country, and I liked the experience although it was hard to get used to that distance (5k). I got to know some of the seniors from my small school very well and they helped me train.  

I wanna get better at sprints but also XC. I am definitely a better sprinter and plan on being a better sprinter than distance runner, but wanna know your guys opinions on this. Can I train to be a great sprinter and XC runner? Does that work doing both? If so what do I do to train both? If not what should I do to be the best at one?

Culture is your daily practices that determine the kind of person and team you are. The top runners and teams you compete against have runners going to bed early and getting miles done before school. The successful teams are focused on their goals and develop  lifestyle and habits that enable them to compete at a high level.

This year was my first year doing cross country and I had joined on a whim with a few friends. At the beginning when I tried to do the summer practices I could barely run 1 mile without having to stop. Two weeks go by and I manage to do 2. Then 3 then 4 and so on. My first ever meet was at the end of August and I got a 35:00 5k. I was very cautious that first meet because I was so scared to feel tired, like REALLY tired where you’re gasping for air and your hands are on your knees. But it still felt good. Every meet that came after I kept getting PR’s even if the times weren’t that great- I still felt proud. I worked so hard at practices even if I was the slowest and weakest. I worked so hard and it was so worth it. I just had a meet last saturday and I PR’d a 26:00 5k. I have definitely felt the change and I am so happy that I was able to achieve something for once. My friends have all PR’d and improved a lot as well. Everyone on the cross country team is so friendly and supportive, everyone feels like family. They will cheer you on in your races and eat pasta with you and it’ll just feel amazing to experience something like that. The team was my only support. They kept me going. My family wasn’t very supportive of me joining XC in the first place so they never showed up to my meets. The only thing I had to ever prove to anyone was that I worked hard. So if you’re still feeling hopeless and unmotivated to join/continue XC, just remember the hard work that you put into it will always reward you. I still remember when I was coming on here to post about how unmotivated and bad I felt just trying to practice running, and people would try and tell me to keep going, so here I am now: the happiest I have ever felt.

I’m on JV and today was our last meet as a team (the next two are I believe qualifiers). I had 2 goals this season: one, no stopping and two, sub 30.

The first one was easier said than done for sure but I really pushed myself anyways (this was one of the more difficult courses for my school). Sadly, I made it like 2.5 miles no stopping (it was the beginning of a big hill and idk I just stopped). I’m proud of myself for making it that far no stopping considering, any other time we ran there, I stopped maybe 1-1.5 miles in so this was a big improvement. But still I was really close to the finish and I probably could’ve made it.

The second obviously depended on my pace and the fact of me stopping in the race.

My last time: 35:50 I believe 

I figured if I’m lucky, if I don’t stop and keep a good pace I might be able to break 30. 

I was right. 

But- that didn’t happen. It would’ve if I wouldn’t have stopped at the hill because guess what? 

I was SECONDS away from sub 30.

I watched the clock as I crossed and got around 30:05 maybe? 

Am I proud of the fact that I almost shaved off a full minute? Yes of course. I mean, last meet of the season for me and I pr by almost a minute. 

Am I upset that I didn’t break 30 because of something as simple as not stopping when I did and putting a little more effort into my kick? Most definitely.

I will say though my thighs were *aching* by the time I reached the last 200, which played a role in me not pushing myself as hard as I would’ve for the last 200 like at usual meets but still I feel like I should’ve and could’ve done better n I’m sad because this was the last one for me this year.

I know the course it's on and I wouldn't be able to PR even in good shape so its out of the question right now but regardless of times I'm the 5th fastest on my team so I'm still a deciding factor in a team win not to mention we already have our top 2 guys out(we have some sort of flu or something going around our school) so that puts me at the 3rd fastest if I was in shape. The reason I'm so hesitant to sit this one out is that the guys ""filling in"" for our 4th and 5th spots are 2 minutes behind me on a good day and they guy who would basically take my place is even 2 minutes behind the other guys. All of this is to say that if I were to run tomorrow I could still be important to a team win at this meet but it might leave me in pretty bad shape for our district championship in a few weeks which would be like a 150+ person meet that I have a solid chance at placing in the top 15 maybe even top 10 at.

## running experience

I came into the race expecting not to get that great of a time as I had eaten too much earlier that day. I also had some leg pain yesterday that made me unable to practice yesterday. I thought i could get anywhere from around 16 minutes to around 20 minutes.

The course was very hilly, being somewhat on a mountain. It started with one lap around the track, which i did in 1:32 (too fast?), then it went onto the road up to the higher soccer field. I was still holding around 6:40 pace up the hill after slowing down from the fast start. I went around the field and back down the hill with a time of 6:35 for the first mile. Does anyone remember the kid i stayed with for a while on week 5? i stayed with him from mile 0.5 to around 1.5 before passing him. it was pretty much flat from 1.1-1.5, I was just going around some fields. up to this point, I had held 6:40-6:50 pace for the majority of it. after going around, it was basically uphill for 1/4 of a mile. It started just as a hill up a road, but then we turned onto a very steep grass path. This was so bad for running, that it was then called the ""green monster."" At this point, I probably had about 40% of my energy for running left. This 200 meters took most of it. I couldn't maintain a good pace from this, and was pretty much holding 7:50 pace up it. I was so close to stopping at many places throughout it and thought it would kill the run. It was mostly flat and downhill from here, but I was too tired to go back to a good pace. I was also starting to get the feeling i was about to throw u, so that slowed me down. I could have probably gotten to 7:10 pace there but I didn't think i could do it without throwing up. I had to hold 7:30 to 8 minute pace going down the hill and i think that killed the run. from here, it was just one lap on the track and I did that in 1:37. I believe the green monster cost me about 45 seconds

I dropped 5 seconds in my mile time (from a 7:55 to a 7:50), 45 seconds on my 2 mile time (18:02 to 17:17), and my season 5k pr was from a 29:05 to an 28:40 which i was super happy about because this season has just been such a struggle.

Hoping to get a sub 18 next year, and this year my goal now is to consistently get 19. Feeling great. Keep pushing people, you can reach your goals if you keep pushing.

Big edit: This meet was initially counted as a 5k, and even advertised itself as one, but now it has been marked down to a 3 mile meet.

Also, how do I tell my coach?",6,qbfhw2,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qbfhw2/im_worried_ive_been_running_on_a_stress_fracture/,3,"\*\*Apologies if this kind of post isn't allowed; please remove if it isn't - I'm not seeking medical advice, mainly just asking if this is a stress fracture and how to let my coach know (since I've been running on it for so long)\*\*

The day before pre season (mid august), I was running and I noticed that the inside of my shin bone (tibia) kinda hurt or was twinging during the run. I did some googling and thought it might be posterior tibia tendonitis (PTT). The pain was usually only a 1 or 2, and half the time I didn't feel it - sometimes it flared up but I was able to forget about it, and now here I am - I've run in several races, and been training every week. I guess I've sort of gotten used to it (and as I said it doesn't really hurt that bad; it's been very mild and pretty manageable), but then it started hurting a on my run yesterday to the point where my stride felt weird and that I felt weird walking and starting up again every time we stopped. Now, I think I need to address it.  


I'm actually not sure it's PTT and am really worried it's a stress fracture. The pain is actually a few inches higher up on my shin (I can't remember if I started feeling pain lower). Bending down to squat/lean forward/and tie my shoe hurts it. Foam rolling the inside of my shin on this area hurts so bad. When I jump off of things and land on it, it hurts. There is sort of an area that hurts when I press down (of course, now as I write this, I can't feel it as much). It doesn't really hurt that much to walk on (unless I'm walking after it flared up during a run).  


Up until yesterday's run, it hadn't gotten worse, but it hadn't gone away. I was able to run with it barely or not at all bothering me. I think what really is the red flag is how much pain I have been in trying to foam roll it.  


Lastly, should I tell my coach that I've been running through this for 2 months? I think I have to be straightforward and explain that it wasn't bothering me much (I often forget about it). I really want to race in our race this weekend, and I don't know how it's going to feel today. But at the same time, I don't want to do permanent damage. Help! Thanks so much!",1634661954.0

my mile trials throughout the season and my opinions on cross country,8,qb40ze,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/qb40ze/my_mile_trials_throughout_the_season_and_my/,1,"context: i'm a sophomore in highschool, this is my first year of doing cross country. past running experience includes 7th, 8th, and 9th grade track and field.

1st mile trial: >!7:20-30ish!<

we ran this trial around the third day of practice. this is about the same time I ran the mile in 8th grade. to me, there was much more room to improve. following the trial came a series of hard track days, footwork days, tempo runs, long runs, and hills. I did my best to work hard on each workout and I believe that work paid off for my next trial.

>!2nd mile trial: 6:20 flat!<

we ran this trial, I believe, on September 27 which was a good four weeks after the first trial. I was incredibly impressed by my performance as I never in my life broke 7 minutes, or better yet, 6:30 on the mile. the sheer amount of dopamine coursing through my veins were enough to make me resistant from pain. that day was one of my most prideful days that I even look back to.

following this mile trial came even harder series of workouts in the same format as the first workouts. everything was longer, more intense, and more tiring. yet everyday I felt myself getting stronger and stronger. I could feel the incredible difference in strength from the first day of practice to September 27th. I was able to recover faster from workouts, run faster 400s, and outpace some of my fellow contenders. never in my life have I ever felt the accomplishments of working... hard. and in few weeks time, I would see the final result of my efforts.

>!3rd mile trial: 5:48!<

this mile trial really just made my jaw drop to the ground. I couldn't believe my time when I first saw it. I know, I know, some of you top runners are probably saying, ""thats my jog pace"" or something like that. but to me, this time shows how my time reflected the effort I put in. I was able to see how much I've grown in only 8-10 weeks. I grew not just in strength, but in my overall character and work ethic.

cross country has taught me that working hard, meticulously and tediously, will always show great results. nothing beats accomplishing something you worked so hard for, even if it wasn't a goal. I'm glad I undertook this journey and I can't wait for more improvement.

then, after indoor track, i suffered a hip injury. could no longer run. 4 months later, i was diagnosed with an eating disorder and i wasn’t allowed to run or join cross country in the fall. i was gutted and constantly cried and complained about it. i was eventually allowed to join late into the season and from there, it just wasn’t the same. i was still injured and i was much slower than i was the previous year. i did not run at all over the rest of the year or the summer because my hip was in constant agony and ed recovery has given me severely low self esteem as i’ve gained a fair bit of weight. i still joined cross country this year though because i have friends on the team and i was hoping it would give me some sense of happiness again. unfortunately, i feel like it has just made everything worse. my 5k times are a good 12 minutes slower than in my freshman year, my teammates are much faster than me so i always end up running alone, my hip STILL hurts and i feel like everyone is judging me. i am so hyperaware of every part of myself (i.e. my thighs and stomach) and i constantly compare myself to the (thinner) runners on my team that are faster than me. obviously, this makes me want to revert back to my old eating habits. running just doesn’t make me feel like it once did, in fact it makes me feel awful all the time now. all i can think about is how i’m not as good or thin as i once was. i seriously want to quit, but i love my coach and teammates. and i miss the joy i felt so much. none of them really know what i’m going through, though. i feel like i’m more of a burden than a good teammate.",1633977955.0

Total: 7 hours (5 hrs 36 min down week)+2-3 hrs on bike. 55.5 miles, easy/hard split 80/20 by time.

Normally I go an extra 10-20 min compared to the rest of the club (standard is 6-7 miles). On Friday they cut it to 2-3 miles, which I personally feel is too short, especially for how far I'm going. On the previous 2 weekends, I've cut my Friday run to 48 min (6 miles), with races on Saturday. Since this is my first year essentially self-coaching, I don't fully know what the ideal distance is.

Also, our final race is on the 20th of November, so I have 6 weeks (including this week) before that happens. I don't have 100% confidence in my schedule. I've heard conflicting things ranging from I'm cutting too late already, to cut only 2 weeks before, so what would be the ideal time to taper and taper %?

Thank you for any and all advice.",1633976151.0

I have Winter Track coming up in a month, and I’m heavily debating to quit. I’ve gone into my story in detail so I’m just going to be quick about it now. I’ve had 3 stress fractures, 1 on my lower left back and 2 on my right fibula. I’ve also had 2 surgeries that were unrelated to running but set me back in my fitness. I’ve also had 2 ankle sprains, and multiple stress reactions in my feet. I have also dealt with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis. All of these injuries I have dealt with in the past three years. I’ve been to so many physical therapy sessions for each injury as well as many different doctors, but I can’t seem to get a break from these injuries. 

I missed my entire freshman year, and was finally able to run my sophomore year. I had a pretty good sophomore year when it came to running. I was most proud of my mile time, which was 5:05 that I ran during Winter track. I missed my sophomore spring track season due to an emergency surgery, and I ran only a couple races during my junior year and was a lot slower since I was running through injury. 

During the summer of my junior year going into senior year I got a second stress fracture on my fibula. I just recently recovered from that stress fracture and after weeks of PT I was cleared to run again. I had my first race in cross country about 2 months ago which was a 4K. I ran such a slow time, even during recovery days I run faster then what I ran. Also, after the run my fibula, which I had two stress fractures on, STILL hurts. I spoke to my doctor and I ended up having to quit the team. 

I have Winter Track coming up soon, and even though I’m not in much pain this instant I haven’t been running since every time I do fibula flares up. I’m just so disappointed and I honestly just want to quit. I don’t know what it is with me, I’ve gotten my running form analyzed, I’ve even been to a chiropractor. I just can’t seem to get a break from injury and it’s honestly making me hate running. 

I’ve already decided that in college if I run I want it to be STRICTLY casual, probably something like a club team so college recruiting shouldn’t be an issue. If I do quit, I won’t waste my time. I’ll probably get a part time job and start going to the gym, but then again this is my last opportunity to run for my school. Any advice would be appreciated.",1633885178.0

Seeking workout help for Championships,5,q575ya,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/q575ya/seeking_workout_help_for_championships/,5,"Hi everyone, first time posting here.

I’ve been coaching XC for 11 years. I have a bit of a unique situation this year so I’d love any advice from experienced runners or coaches that I can get.

We are exactly 10 days out from our County Championship race. We are 20 days out from our District Championships.

My top girl ran a 19:39 at an invite yesterday. It’s 20 seconds better than her PR from last season, where she finished 12th at our county meet and 25th at districts in her first year of XC as a junior.

She is a bit concerned because she feels like she has nothing to give in the last mile of the race. She looks VERY strong in mile 1, but she usually doesn’t move up in the race after the mile mark… but she doesn’t lose spots either. Yesterday she was 9th at the mile and finished 8th. It’s usually like that. Other girls do creep up on her and they make it very close in the last 800, but she ultimately hangs on. Or she’ll be in a pack and they break away from her in that last 800. She’s worried going into counties and districts that those girls that work up toward her during these invites will finally pass her at this point in the season, as she has no kick to end a race.

Does anyone have any advice or workouts I could utilize in these last 10/20 days to help her kick better at the end or get her confidence up? She’s the most coachable athlete I’ve ever had and her motivation is unmatched so whatever advice you have she will take it and use it.

## The Race

**Early Race**

I came in as 2nd on the team, expecting to get 4th place overall based on what I'd heard about the team we were facing. When we started on the track, I set out at around 6:40 pace for the first lap. This put me right behind the front group. I left the track around 1:30 at around 360 meters. I stayed towards the back of this group until we went around the first tight corner. I pulled to the right while everyong was close to the left, and passed about three people by doing so. By the end of the first mile I was in the front of the group. I finished the first loop of the course plus lap of the track in about 7:15 (6:24 pace??)

**Mid Race**

I was still holding a steady pace of around 6:50/mile, and right behind the second fastest person on my team, expecting him to eventually slow down. This never ended up happening in the middle of the race and I stayed behind him for the next mile. That person and I were in 3rd and 4th place at the time.

**End Race**

I was still with him until the very end and our coach encouraged me to stick with him and for him to try to stick in front. This is about when i start to speed up (from 6:50 to 6:30 pace). I was now starting to feel too tired (this started around halfway in, about where I expect it to). Theres one mile left and I'm trying to stay with him. I gradually got closer for the next half mile. Around half a mile left, #2 on the opposing team slows down a bit. My teammate passes him, then about 30 seconds later I pass him. about a minute later, I pass my teammate, then right after he passes me back. This exchange is going on for the next 1-2 minutes, and the coach is encouraging us to try to stick together. Now all that was left was about 300 meters on the track. I went full out at the end, at around 6:10 mile pace, starting to feel numb. My teammate started getting a bad cramp and had to slow down. I was now all alone in the front of the group. The opponent from the other team started full sprinting at low 5 pace and I wasn't trying to keep up until it was too late. with 100 meters to go, the gap between the two of us was about 20 meters and we were both full sprinting. He finished about 5 seconds before me. My teammate with the cramp ended up getting a time of 20:56.

(the boys didn't win). My PR (last week) is 15:47 for a 2-mile race, and I got 5th place.

Four of us came to the practice today, and I was the only girl on my old team that came (unfortunately). We ran 10 400s with my goal time being 1:50ish. My best time was 1:25 and my slowest time was 1:38. What really surprised me was that I was faster than all of the girls on JV (that came to practice today) every single time.

I think I could've PR'd in the 5k in high school if I had paced myself better....,17,q3ivgx,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/q3ivgx/i_think_i_couldve_prd_in_the_5k_in_high_school_if/,1,"I'm a female runner currently running D3 cross country and enjoying it so far! For us, we now mostly run 6ks, and I've actually enjoyed the distance even more than the 5k. What's interesting is I've been coming through the 5k mark in the race only 30 seconds off my high school PR (on a fast course). Basically in the two 6ks I've raced, I'm tying my second best high school 5k time (and I still have a whole kilometer to go!). While I'd like to think I've improved somewhat (which maybe I have), I really don't think I've gotten faster. I think I'm just pacing much much better. 

In high school I felt like I maybe slightly improved from freshman year but ran at pretty much the same times from sophomore to senior year. I would always go out the first mile in 6:20 or 6:30, and then die, run some 8 or even 9 minute last miles (if it was a really hot day) and finish around 21 or 22  minutes. My PR, a race I'm still proud of, was when I was 6:30/7/7 and got 21:0x. I think a lot of PR's can be set from positive splitting, but I've decided that that strategy is not the best for me. 

Now, I run the first mile of each 6k at my goal race pace or slower, and end up running the middle two miles the fastest (by about 10 seconds). I feel great passing people and coming through the 5k mark at a time I'd be happy with for even a 5k encourages me. Something I need to work on is saving something for the last 800m (because I think I start booking it at the 3 mile mark because I'm so shocked I still feel okay!). I've gotten calmer with starting out back of pack (starts can be hectic anyway and there will be a chance to pass people later, so I try not to weave). 

So, if I were to race a 5k again, I'd definitely go out at my goal pace and try to work down from there. 

Just a reminder that positive splits far fine as long as they're not super duper positive. I think aiming for even splits is key (because starting too too conservative at start isn't always great either). If your race strategy isn't working right now and you're dying half way in, maybe try this approach!",1633641320.0

There are websites where all of our teams’s times get posted, and you can see all the race results and my name is on there despite me not running in these races. He gave my bib number to some kid who runs a 26 minute 5k, while my 5k is in the 19 minute range. I emailed the website since I thought it was an error, and I also spoke to my coach about it. The coach told me that I went out of line by emailing them and that it wasn’t his problem. He also told me that I was wrong for quitting the team due to my stress fracture and I should have been a team manager instead of completely quitting. I really don’t want these times on my profile since I am a senior and plan on running in college, and also I simply just don’t want other people’s race results under my name. Should I complain to my school’s athletic department? I tried speaking to him and obviously that didn’t work out, so I don’t know what the next step is.",1633470824.0

I've been insanely unlucky with injuries. First here is each injury (? is date unsure as it developed over time) and major event:

* March 6th, 2018: Last race in race fitness (10k). Triple PR (5k 17:47, 8k 29:08, 10k 36:29). Held 45 miles a week the 8 weeks prior. Previous season XC PR 17:53.
* April 2nd, 2018: Injury 1: Tendentious in knee. Out 56 days of senior year track (missed a race for sickness). Cause: Too fast easy runs.
* Inconsistent summer going into college (ranged from 10-30 miles a week, club team), but got a 16:57 PR (Nov 17th 2018) in the 5k. I was not in race fitness as I was not hitting the goals on my workouts, but hit this somehow (no it was not short). For context below I did 3 8ks and 1 5k, with a SR of 30:01 in the 8k
* November 20th 2018: Injury 2: Shin Splints: Cause: Jumping from 28 miles to 60 miles after losing a bet. Out 16 days.
* January 3rd 2019: Injury 3: Tendentious in knee: Cause: Unknown as I was doing 15 miles a week and only easy runs. Out 70 days.
* July ? 2019: Injury 4/5: Stress Fracture Tibia, plus tendentious in knee. Cause: Jump to 65 miles for one week with the jump being in intensity distance, not easy distance. Out 262 days. Started cycling for context here. 
* July ? 2020: Injury 6/7: Stress reaction foot and stress reaction tibia. Cause: Unknown. Out 103 days. Week before 270 minutes/35 miles.
* November 9th 2020: Injury 8/9: Pulled stomach muscle on a run and foot tendentious. Became uninjured December 24th, this time for good (so far). Cause: Unknown. Week before: 120 minutes/14 miles.

Now I've been holding 7 hours/55.5 miles a week, plus 2-3 hours more on the bike, and have been the most consistent I've ever been running (yes I've held 55 for 4 weeks before, but in 2017). Cycling really helped and there was other things I did to correct my form. I took training back conservatively ever since injury 5, and I just found the system that worked for me. I took a few time trials on a track to see my fitness progression, plus my first official race since November 20th 2018 (5k rankings are out of 60 (only top 10) from 5ks, or splits in 8k or 10k races or TTs):

* May 21st: 18:27 5k
* July 10th: 18:04 5k (7th)
* August 6th: 18:11 5k (9th) (Went out too fast and cracked mile 2)
* August 30th: 29:28 8k (20 mph wind though)

Then came the race this past Saturday. I didn't know how it would go. I've essentially lost 3 years of fitness prior to the comeback, but was excited coming back to the collegic club cross country team to race. I ended up getting 29:18. Sure it was 86th/120th. No it was not a PR (though in a 8k race it was). Granted it was a hilly course. I am not upset about any of this. I had the best race I could have on that day, and the best feeling race possibly ever. After injury 4/5 I was told I would not get back to where I was in high school, and this was repeated with the further injuries, and now I'm back where I was, and am hitting better numbers than I was in high school workouts.

To anyone out there who are going through a similar situation, just know this. You can get back. No one except you determines what you can and can't do. There will be frustrations, and setbacks. That's unfortunately life. But nothing will beat that feeling of finally getting back, showing the world (and your haters) what you can do, that you can power through this. Because you can. You will.
