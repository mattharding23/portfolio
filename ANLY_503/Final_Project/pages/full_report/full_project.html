	<h1>Success Factors in NCAA Division 1 Cross Country</h1>
      <h3>Authors: Matt Harding, Scott Johnson, Jude Moukarzel, Matt Young</h3>
	<p style = "text-align:center">Project Group 26</p>
      <br>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	Running is a type of activity widely seen as a form of endurance training in order to improve one’s cardiovascular health. 
	Just like any activity, there are those who do it for recreational purposes, and others who do it with a more competitive spirit. 
	Wherever you personally may fall in that spectrum, whether you are a hobby-jogger training for a community 5K, a top-tier athlete running upwards of 80 miles a week, or just getting into the sport, this exploration into the success factors in NCAA Division 1 Cross Country will provide inquisitive insights that you may learn from and employ in your next training block, so that you will have no problem achieving your next running goal. 
	<br>
	<br>
	It should be noted that although this webpage focuses on the specific success factors for NCAA Division 1 Cross Country, anyone who wants to learn more about ways in which they could better their training or attain a new personal record for any race distance will still learn valuable lessons. 
	This is because the sport of Cross Country, and running as a whole, does not discriminate and does not have high costs of entry. 
	All you need are a good pair of shoes and practically anyone can find solace, enjoyment, and a competitive passion in this simple activity. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The sport of Cross Country may not be as popular or often discussed in the media compared to other NCAA sports such as football or basketball; however, one would likely be surprised to learn that of the 358 educational institutions within the first division of the NCAA, 319 have a Men’s Cross Country Team, and 349 have a Women’s Cross Country Team 
	<a href="https://web3.ncaa.org/directory/memberList?type=12&division=I" target='_blank'>[1]</a>
	<a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/articles-1/cross-country-colleges" target='_blank'>[2]</a>. 
	To provide additional perspective, there are only 254 of these NCAA Division 1 Universities and Colleges that have a Men’s Football Team (125 FCS and 129 FBS) 
	<a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/football/division-1-colleges" target='_blank'>[3]</a>. 
	Thus, the sport of Cross Country, though an often-underappreciated sport, is much more widespread within the NCAA and offers opportunities for a vast range of student-athletes. 
	Moreover, those that do participate in the sport are extremely driven and passionate about being the best athletes they can be, always searching for ways that might enable them to run faster than they ever have before. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Undoubtedly, there are a range of factors that are influential to any athlete’s competitive success. 
	Specific to the sport of Cross Country, one such factor that has been previously researched is training at high altitudes. 
	The majority of these studies conclude that training at high altitudes does positively benefit these athletes in overall athletic performance
	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5213424/" target='_blank'>[4]</a>. 
	Even so, there are still a vast number of other variables influential to overall success in this sport that have yet to be extensively studied. 
	As such, this project has identified and will analyze not only the variable of high altitude training but additional variables and their relationship to Cross Country team performance.
	Specifically, the variables being explored are: the communication surrounding the sport, the elevation changes across a racecourse, the effect of a school’s altitude, the effect of race day weather conditions, and the tendency to either under or over-perform at a championship race.

		<h3>"Words" on the Street</h3>
  			<p>
			Reddit can be considered by some as the "front page of the internet". It currently ranks among the top 10 most popular sites in the U.S. and does a good job at enabling users to post news content or share feelings/comments on any particular topic.
			<br><br>
			Within Reddit, there exists an abundance of communities known as "subreddits", each covering a different topic. Specific to this analysis, the main topic of interest is regarding running and what language the Reddit community employed to discuss this topic. What are people’s concerns and feelings towards this activity?
			<br><br>
			Using the 2 popular subreddits “Track and Field” and “Cross Country”, approximately 1000 posts were gathered and analyzed in order to find patterns that might be helpful in driving later analysis. 
			Figure 1 on the right is a Word Cloud that highlights the frequently used words when it comes to the conversation regarding the sports of Cross Country and Track and Field on Reddit. 
			In the visual, it can be observed that words like "run" and "track" appear to be the most frequent, which is understandable as these words are directly related to the topic. 
			However, other words like "advice", "coach", “school”, "team", "race", "season", "pace", and "time" are also predominant. 
			The first two of these words, “advice” and “coach”, seem to denote importance in one's coaching and the training they are conducting. 
			Furthermore, the next two words, “school” and “team” might reference the institutions that an athlete is competing for. 
			Finally, the remaining predominant words all seem to focus on the action of racing and the factors within it such as the pace and time. 
			Even so, these are all just initial hypotheses at this time and further exploration into the actual frequency of use for each of these words would be beneficial.

  		Upon initial observation, there seemed to be some predominant words utilized in the discussion of the sports of Cross Country and Track and Field. Figure 2 on the right is an interactive bar graph that displays the exact frequencies of each of the predominant words. This figure provides the ability to observe an overarching pattern. The overall theme of all these Reddit posts tends to gravitate around the desire to perform better in this sport, whether in a team-like setting, such as a school, or individually. People are often employing vocabulary that is used for asking for advice on how to outdo themselves – how to run more miles in less time at a sustainable pace. And of course, people are wondering – how to be successful in this sport, for your team and your school, and bring home the gold!

  		<h3>Significant Performing Teams at the NCAA Championships</h3>
  		<p>
      	Moving forward, the analysis will begin to focus more heavily on factors related to the NCAA Division 1 Cross Country Championship Meet. 
		To provide a brief background understanding, thirty-one teams are selected to participate in this Championship Meet. 
		There are nine regional races prior to the Championship Meet and the top two, seven-person teams automatically qualify from each of these regional races, for a total of 18 teams. 
		Following that, 13 additional teams are selected in an at-large capacity based on their placement at the regional races. 
		Finally, thirty-eight individuals are also selected to participate in each Championship Meet through an automatic qualifier and at-large selection process, if they did not already qualify for the Championship Meet with their team. <a href='https://www.ncaa.com/news/cross-country-men/article/2021-11-13/2021-ncaa-division-i-mens-and-womens-cross-country-championship-qualifiers#:~:text=The%20top%20two%2C%20seven%2Dperson,and%20at%2Dlarge%20selection%20process' target='_blank'>Source: NCAA</a>
<br><br>
        If a team finishes in the top 4 at the NCAA Cross Country Championship Meet, they are a podium team and go home with a trophy. Becoming a podium team is extremely difficult, but certain teams have consistently earned podium positions over the last 11 years.
<br><br>
        Figure 3 is an interactive collection of pie charts, accounting for schools with the most podium appearances in the last 11 years. When hovering, you can see each specific team, the number of podium placements, and the average podium placement.
<br><br>
        Ultimately, this pie plot displays the fact that Northern Arizona, Colorado, BYU, and Oklahoma State have historically been the best teams on the Men's side. Additionally, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, and Stanford have historically been the best teams on the Women's side. Following this section will be a look closer at the specific factors that may contribute to these teams' relative continual success at the NCAA Championship Cross Country Meet.

The map allows runners to visualize the topography and interact with the markers to understand the course better and develop strategies based on the visualization. <br /> <a href='Code/Course_Map_Code/topographical_course.R' target='_blank'>Source Code</a>">
  			<h3>Topography of Course Map</h3>
    <p>

        One of the variables with the highest variance in Cross Country is the topography of the course. This is because races are run on courses that are not altered to be flat surfaces like tracks are. In order to help runners to understand and visualize a course before they run it, having a map of the topography would be very helpful. In addition to that, it can help both coaches and runners to study the course to understand which types of runners have more success on that course.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the last <a href = "https://live.pttiming.com/XC-PTT.html?mid=2431" target='_blank'>NCAA Men's National Championship</a> run on the Apalachee Regional Park Cross Country Course, Notre Dame and Arkansas were most forwardly placed during the first third of the race while teams like Northern Arizona, BYU, and Oklahoma State sat within striking distance but were not pushing the pace. Northern Arizona, the eventual winner, made their move in the second third of the race and never gave way after that. BYU and Oklahoma State, who placed second and third, waited until the final third of the race to make their move. Notre Dame ended up in fourth while Arkansas ended up in ninth. Clearly, the teams that waited to make their move had the correct strategy while the teams who got out to fast starts likely used up too much of their energy too early in the race. A map that helps runners understand the course's changes in topography could help runners to understand the course better and strategize in order to avoid the situation Notre Dame and Arkansas ended up in. 
        <br />
        <br />
        This is exactly what the creative and innovative visualization  in Figure 4 addresses. It gives runners a bird's eye view of the course with a heat map of the topography as well as indicators of longer uphill and downhill slopes. The heatmap makes it easy to see the topography of the course with cooler colors depicting lower elevation and warmer colors meaning higher elevation. A runner could use this to strategize for a race and try to push on certain parts of a course and try to preserve energy on other taxing portions. The markers on the course give extra insight into how much the elevation changes between certain points. This is especially useful to understand less obvious changes in the slope of a course. For example, a runner might not notice that they are climbing in elevation because the slope is small, but they could end up climbing 10-20m over a longer distance. Additionally, the map allows the user to zoom in and pan for runners and coaches to get a more granular view of the course. This new tool for runners could potentially change the way runners strategize for races and will make it easier for them to visualize the course before they run.

  		<h3>Comparison of Team’s School Altitude and Race Day Performance</h3>
  		<p>
        Within the distance runner community, there are a number of people obsessed with altitude training. Because of this, the altitude of the team’s school is thought to be an important driving factor in the success of a school's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams. Oftentimes, athletes that train at sea level feel as though they cannot compete with athletes who have the luxury of training at higher altitudes. To attempt to get on a level playing field, athletes will travel to a high altitude for approximately two to ten weeks in the summertime in an attempt to maximize training potential. In order to better understand how teams can be more successful, the following table describes the effect on the body when exposed to and training at various altitudes.
  		</p>

  		<table class = "center">
  			<tr>
  				<th>Altitude</th>
					<th>Meters (m) / Feet (ft)</th>
					<th>Effects of Acute Altitude Exposure</th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>Low</td>
					<td style="width:330px">Sea Level – 1,200m / 4,000 ft</td>
					<td style="width:500px">None</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>Moderate</td>
					<td>1,200-2,400m / 4,000-7870 ft</td>
					<td>Mild altitude illness and decreased performance may occur</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>High</td>
					<td>2,400-4,000m / 7870-13,125 ft</td>
					<td>Altitude illness and performance decrements are more common and greater</td>
				</tr>
	
				<tr>
					<td>Very High</td>
					<td>4,000-5,500m / 13,125-18,000 ft</td>
					<td>Altitude illness and performance decrements are more common and greater</td>
				</tr>

  			<tr>
					<td>Extreme</td>
					<td>5,500m / 18,000 ft - and higher</td>

			</div>
			<br />
			<p>
				Although no athletes are training at extreme altitudes, there are many schools that train at moderate, high, and very high altitudes. With "decreased" performance at altitude, athletes often work harder and dig deeper than they would at sea level. Oftentimes athletes try to run just as fast as they do at sea level and in turn actually work harder.
<br><br>
				Figure 5 seeks to show the difference in Cross Country team success between the schools that are at high altitude and low altitude. The threshold for Moderate altitude is considered at 4,000 ft and above. Therefore, the threshold in this visual between high and low altitude is 4,000 ft.
<br><br>
				At the National Cross Country Championship Meet, Men’s schools at high altitudes place on average anywhere from 3.1 to 19.2. In contrast, Men’s schools at low altitudes place on average from 6.5 to 29.5. Furthermore, Women’s schools at high altitudes place on average from 5.1 to 25. In contrast, Women’s schools at low altitudes place on average from 7.1 to 31. Therefore, high altitude schools place higher, on average, at the Championship Meet than low altitude schools.

			<h3>Comparison of Team Performance and Race Day Weather Conditions</h3>
			<p>
				As has been previously discussed, there are a plethora of variables and considerations that go into a successful Cross Country team performance. 
				Cross Country teams will spend months and years training and preparing for the National Cross Country meet each November. 
				Even so, there is one variable that can never be truly prepared for: the weather on race day. 
				The variable of weather conditions is uncontrollable by all teams and its effects are unbiased – with every athlete experiencing the same conditions. 
				Because of this unique uncontrollable and unbiased nature, an investigation into how national-caliber teams performed across various weather conditions was catalyzed to help determine what teams competed to their potential even in the harshest of weather conditions.
				<br>
				<br>
				The following visualization utilizes a radar chart to denote the relative team performance for both the Men and Women’s races at four recent NCAA Cross Country Championship Meets, each of which experienced vastly different weather conditions: Rain, Snow, Sun, and Wind. 
				The following table is included to help provide additional context to the variables related to each weather condition investigated and the location and year of each race.

				The default rendering of this visual represents the team performances of the Arkansas Men’s Cross Country team in each weather condition. 
				Large team performance scores, and the associated longer edges of the polygon created in the radar chart, denote strength in a specific weather condition. 
				While small team performance scores, and the associated small edges of the polygon in the radar chart, denote weakness in a specific weather condition.
				Specifically, this team performance score is representative of how well a team placed at the NCAA Cross Country Championship Meet that experienced one of the associated weather conditions; with high performance scores (strength) denoting teams that placed in the top of the meet, and low performance scores (weakness) denoting teams that were not as competitive and placed in the bottom of the meet.
				<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, this visual allows for an easy user interface to select between the Gender of a team being displayed, as well as the ability to select multiple teams at once to allow for easy team-by-team comparison of performance in varying weather conditions. 
				It should be noted that not every team qualified for the NCAA Championship Meet in each of the respective years being investigated and thus they have no team performance score for that weather condition. 
				For example:

    					If a team only participated in two of the four Championship Meets, they will only have two data points on two weather axes and no radar shape (see Georgetown Men’s team for example)
    					</li>
    					<li>
    					If a team only participated in three of the four Championship Meets, they will only have three data points on three weather axes with an associated radar shape object (see Air Force Men’s team for example)
  					</li>
					<li>
					Also worth noting is that in some cases only one of the school’s two teams (either men or women) qualified and competed in the Championship Meet in each of these specific years and thus, the visual will only display an empty axis object for the gender team that did not compete (see New Mexico Men’s team for example)
					</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>
				With this increased understanding of how to best engage with and interpret this visual, it is encouraged to investigate and observe the performance strength of teams in varying weather conditions. 
				Specifically, teams that have been previously noted as highly successful/competitive. 
				In doing so, one will likely find that teams such as the Northern Arizona Men’s team, BYU Men’s team, and the New Mexico Women’s team continually race well at the Championship Meet no matter the weather condition; while other often successful teams, such as the University of Colorado Men’s and Women’s teams and the Oregon Women’s team, have a larger variation of race performances between the different weather conditions investigated. 
				In summary, the weather conditions on race day seem to have varying impacts on a national caliber Cross Country team’s race day performance.

  		<h3>Change from Previous Week Ranking to Performance at the NCAA Cross Country Championship Meet </h3>
  		<p>
  		Building on the factors discussed above, teams tend to over and underperform based on expert predictions prior to competition. This will always exist within the world of sports because of a variety of factors. A great example of failed predictions is March Madness, where people across the world try to predict the perfect bracket. The odds of predicting the perfect bracket are one in 9.2 quintillion, according to <a href = "https://www.npr.org/2022/04/01/1089532191/march-madness-perfect-bracket#:~:text=The%20odds%20of%20predicting%20a,are%20one%20in%209.2%20quintillion." target = "_blank">NPR</a>. Similar to March Madness, experts never perfectly predict the performance of all 31 competing teams per gender at the NCAA Cross Country Championship Meet.
<br><br>
  		Despite the difficulty to predict the performance of a team at the Championship Meet, the change in performance prediction and actual race performance is normally distributed; with the majority of counts of ranking change (frequency) lying in the middle of the distribution. This means that the previous ranking is typically a good indicator of how well a team will perform at the National Championship Meet.
<br><br>
      In Figure 7, first, select the gender and teams that you would like to observe. Arkansas Men's and Women's teams are already instantiated for the first example. Then, on the scatterplot, select a point for either the Men's or Women's team and see how the distribution of ranking changes for your selected gender compared to the total distribution of ranking changes on the linked histogram. When hovering over the scatterplot, the tooltip shows the label, ranking change, and year of the scatterplot. Additionally, the tooltip of the histogram shows the average binned ranking change.
</p>
      <p>Some important schools and trends to look at include:</p>
<ul style = "font-size:15px; font-family:arial, san-serif; color:#000000">
  <li>
    <b>(Default) Action:</b> <u>Select</u> Men & Women. <u>Select</u> Arkansas. <u>Click on Scatterplot.</u><br><b>Trend:</b> Arkansas Men tend to overperform more often than the Women's team
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Action:</b> <u>Select</u> Women. <u>Select</u> BYU & Washington. <u>Click on Scatterplot.</u><br><b>Trend:</b> BYU tends to overperform, and Washington tends to underperform
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Action:</b>  <u>Select</u> Men & Women. <u>Select</u> Wisconsin. <u>Click on Scatterplot.</u><br><b>Trend:</b> Wisconsin Women and Men tend to overperform
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Overall, predicting performance for a championship is often difficult and will never be entirely correct. Some teams are generally underestimated by experts, like the BYU Women's team. However, other teams are highly overestimated by experts, like the Washington Women's team. Even with notably incorrect estimations, the plurality of teams have a net ranking change of 0 among all genders. Therefore, the previous week's ranking is a good indicator of how well a team will perform at the NCAA Cross Country Championships.

			<p>
			Although in the end this project only analyzed five specific variables related to successful Cross Country racing performance, there are a multitude of other factors that are integral to overall competitive success as a runner and athlete. Even so, the five variables analyzed, and their associated discussions, have still provided a range of valuable insights. Firstly, the exploration of the communication surrounding the sport of Cross Country catalyzed the initial hypothesis that there are specific aspects of this sport that are more often discussed than others, and thus potentially more important. These such aspects include: the coaching and training of an athlete, the institution that an athlete represents and competes for, and the action of running a race. In summary, it was concluded that the running community is predominately communicating methods and reasonings for becoming the fastest athlete one can be.
			<br><br>
			Following it was determined that, within NCAA Division 1 Cross Country, there are approximately six Men’s teams and six Women’s teams across nine different universities that have been consistently competing to a high level at the NCAA National Championship Cross Country Meet. Each of these nine universities at first glance do not seem to have any commonalities, except that they have all been consistent podium contenders in the last 11 Cross Country Championships. Even so, this knowledge soon became very relevant in further exploration of the remaining variables of interest.
			<br><br>
			Regarding the second variable of interest, the elevation changes across a racecourse, it was observed that some teams executed much smarter races than others. Teams such as the Northern Arizona Men’s team seemed to stay patient and conserve energy at the beginning which enabled them to eventually win the race. From this fact, it was concluded that prior knowledge of the major elevation changes across any racecourse would be extremely beneficial for an athlete, as they too would be able to plan an efficient and smart race strategy. 
			<br><br>
			The variable of the altitude at which a team’s school is located was the next explored variable. As previously mentioned, this variable has been the most openly explored variable in prior research. In turn, the analysis of this project coincided with the conclusions already made in the majority of the other research available; that training at a high altitude does have an observable benefit in the level of competition achieved by a Cross Country team. 
			<br><br>
			The analysis for the fourth variable of interest then attempted to determine if uncontrollable factors such as race day weather conditions had any noticeable effects on the performance of nationally competitive teams. In observing the race day performance for four separate weather conditions it was observed that the majority of the previously defined 12 consistent podium teams had strong race performances regardless of the weather condition experienced. However, some other non-consistent podium teams did seem to have much more variation in their race performances in varying weather conditions.
			<br><br>
			Finally, with an extensive analysis already providing some overarching hypothesis, the exploration of the final variable of interest was primed. This final exploration into the tendency of a team to either over or underperform enabled the conclusion that although some teams do seem to underperform, and others overperform, the majority of teams seem to perform at the level expected of them. Even if that level is at the top and contending for podium placement, the top-ranked teams continually race the fastest. 
			<br><br>
			In summary, the overarching conclusion made from this project is that although some variables may provide some benefits (such as training at a high altitude) and others may cause challenges (such as elevation changes in a racecourse or the weather on race day), the highly successful Men’s and Women’s NCAA Division 1 Cross Country teams are likely to continue to be the top performers at the National Cross Country Championship Meet. 
			<br><br>
			However, let it be abundantly clear that this does not mean other teams and athletes should not continually strive to themselves be a podium team and run faster than they ever have. Realistically there are a range of additional variables that likely have major influence on these 12 teams being continual podium teams. For example, the coaching, the training, the facilities available to athletes, injuries, recruiting of high school athletes, and a plethora of other factors. All this to say that in the end, there is no substitute for hard work. If you have the drive and determination, you too could become a podium contender and run faster than you ever have before.
