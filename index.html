                        <h3>Chesapeake Bay: Dissolved Oxygen Analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            This analysis was completed as a semester long project for an intro data science and analytics class. It goes through the full data science life cycle in an attempt to better understand dissolved oxygen levels within the water of the Chesapeake Bay. The analysis uses Chesapeake Bay water quality data from 2007-2020 to find trends and create predictive models in order to try to understand when and why low level dissolved oxygen level events occur. This gives an overview of many different aspects of data science that I have been exposed to.

                            The NBA salary distribution analysis was completed as a part of a group project that analyzed multiple factors as to how they contribute to winning in the NBA. The salary distribution analysis uses statistical techniques in order to determine whether there are significant difference between how winning and losing teams distribute their salaries. This section displays my ability to apply statistical methods to a real world setting. The link below the image will focus on only the salary distribution analysis, however there is a link to download the full group report <a href = "Salary_Analysis/pages/511Report.pdf" download="511Report.pdf" role = "button">here</a>.

                        <p>



                            The peak cherry blossom predictions analysis was done as part of competition for predicting the date of peak bloom of cherry blossoms at various locations across the world. The goal was to take in historical cherry blossom peak bloom dates and try to predict the peak bloom dates for the next decade. More can be found about the competition at this <a href="cherry_blossoms/pages/README.html" target = "blank">link</a>. Knowing the date of peak bloom is notoriously difficult to predict more than a few weeks in advance. However, it would be advantagous for cities, businesses, and travellers alike to be able to know when the peak bloom will occur months or even years in advance. My prediction utilized historical weather data to run a ridge regression and predict the dates of peak bloom for the next decade in four seperate locations around the world. I received an <b>honorable mention</b> for this competition which involved over 80 entries from individuals and teams across four continents - the full competition results can be found <a href = "https://competition.statistics.gmu.edu/winners-2022/" role = "button">here</a>.

                        <p>
                            For a final project in a data visualization course, myself and group members created visualizations and a narrative in order to help runners at the NCAA division 1 level be more successful. My work focused on our feature visualization which was an interactive topographical map of a national championship cross country course. The purpose of the visualization was to give runners insight into the course before actually running on it so that they can plan out a strategy for their race. The topography is shown by a heatmap overlayed on the map of the course and there are interactive markers showing the peaks and valleys of the course. The entire project narrative created by myself and my teammates can be viewed at the link below the figure.
