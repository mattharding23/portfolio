                            Prior to beginning at Georgetown, Matt earned a bachelor of science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech where he also completed internships with three separate companies. Upon graduation, he spent 2 years at Northrop Grumman as an engineer. In those positions he led multiple projects at a time where he was consistently balancing with needs and ideas of several seperate teams. In his free time, Matt enjoys watching sports, cooking, hiking, fishing, and spending time with his fiance - Jordan, dog - Boomer, friends & family.

                        <p>
                            This analysis was completed as a semester long project for an intro data science and analytics class. It goes through the full data science life cycle in an attempt to better understand dissolved oxygen levels within the water of the Chesapeake Bay. The analysis uses Chesapeake Bay water quality data from 2007-2020 to find trends and create predictive models in order to try to understand when and why low level dissolved oxygen level events occur.
