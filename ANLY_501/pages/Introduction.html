                The Chesapeake Bay has been one of the most important resources available in the Mid-Atlantic region of North America since before Europeans settled there. Before European arrival, it was an ecosystem, share peacefully between Native Americans and other living species such as birds, fish, and crabs. Native Americans relied on the Bay as a source of food, mode of transportation, and resource for commerce. Fish and crabs were plentiful, and Native Americans traveled along the coast of the Bay and its tidal rivers, following their sources of food and repurposing shells and other waste as tools, clothing, and forms of exchange between other tribes.

                As Europeans arrived, the Bay quickly became a center of commerce. With its rivers spanning from Virginia to New York, goods were easily transported to and from the many ports developed in the cities that sat along the Bay's endless shorelines. As farms developed near tributaries of the Bay, farmers too would use the bay to transport  crops to cities to sell. In addition to transportation, the Europeans quickly realized the Bay contained an abundance of resources. The fish were plentiful and so were the beavers, whose furs could be sold or traded. The resources of the Bay immediately became an integral part of the economy in the early day of the colonies.

            	Fast forwarding to the industrial revolution, the Chesapeake Bay remained a vital piece of the American economy. Ports in major cities became large industrial hubs where goods were shipped and received in massive quantities. Large scale factories sprung up along rivers where, among many other things, beaver furs were transformed into clothing items. Industrialists constructed large dams in the rivers outside of the factories in order to power factories as well as large milling operations that were needing to help feed the growing American population. The fishing industry also benefitted from the growth in population as its operations scaled from feeding a family or a small town to feeding entire cities.

        	<p class = 'wrapping_p'>
            	Predictably, these major scaling of industries put a large stress on the ecosystem of Chesapeake Bay region. Pollution from factories and general waste dumped directly into its rivers. The damming of rivers made it impossible for certain fish species to swim up those rivers in order to spawn. Other fish species were overfished as a source of food. Beavers and other animals hunted for furs, became increasingly rare. The changes brought on by the industrial revolution created a major shock to they Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and the Bay ultimately still has not recovered  from this devastation.

            	At the time of the industrial revolution, scientists recognized pollution as harmful to the environment, but the extent of the damage pollution could cause was not understood. As a result, little was done between the industrial revolution and the early 1970s to prevent pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. One federal regulation named the 'Rivers and Harbors Act' was passed around the turn of the 20th century which made the act of polluting the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and other watersheds a misdemeanor and actions such as building dams were now required to be permitted. This Act ultimately had little effect on the continuing pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. Eventually, the invention of the gas engine and subsequently automobiles and gas-powered boats put even more stress on the Bay. Some of the carbon emissions from such engines are absorbed by the Bay, polluting its waters even further. Ultimately in the 1960s and 70s, Congress passed more powerful legislation, a combination of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act which were intended to reduce and control air and water pollution nationwide. These laws did have a much stronger effect than the Rivers and Harbors Act in curbing direct pollution into the water and also set stricter regulations for use of gas engines and other air pollutants.

                However, water pollution from a different industry began to take off around the same time and is the most influential factor on the pollution of the Chesapeake Bay today. The farning industry's use of harmful chemicals in fertilizers and pesticides increased at a rapid rate. In combination with agricultural animal waste, these harmful products found their way into the streams and rivers of the Chesapeake Bay via runoff rainwater and irrigation at alarming rates.

                These pollutants lead to an excess of nitrogen and phosphorus which sets off a recurring chain of events leading to devastating results for the Bay's ecosystem. While nitrogen and phosphorus are naturally occurring elements in the Bay's waters, an oversaturation of these elements leads to a growth in the amount of chlorophyll in the water. Chlorophyll is the food source of phytoplankton which are a food source for many living organisms in the Bay. However, when there is an excess amount of chlorophyll in the water this can lead to a large amount of phytoplankton which is known as an algae bloom. These blooms are dangerous to the Chesapeake Bay for several reasons. First, the bloom of algae blocks sunlight from reaching the floor of the waterways. This can be deadly to the underwater grasses residing on those floors and lead to a food shortage for the organisms that eat those grasses. Algae also consume oxygen that is saturated in the water. When there is an algae bloom, the algae consume a significant amount of oxygen out of the water. Fish and other living organisms rely on the oxygen in the water to breathe. When there is a shortage of oxygen, it becomes difficult for living organisms to breathe. When stressed organisms require even more oxygen which may not be available in the water ultimately suffocating them. Extremely large algae blooms can create what are called dead zones where there is not enough oxygen in the water for organisms to survive. This can cause massive fish kills which after occurring repeatedly can have a severe effect on populations.

            	There have been many initiatives and regulations in the past two decades to try to reduce the argricultural runoff into the Bay. However, these efforts have achieved only limited success due to the fact that the agriculture industry is essential to the overall infrastructure and well-being of the national and local economies and the changes that would need to be made are costly to either farmers and taxpayers. Regulators have had to resort to restricting fishing practices instead in order to preserve fish and crab populations in the area. Specifically - seasonal fishing, size, and amount limits have been imposed on certain species in order to keep populations healthy. For example, one fish population that has been in a constant struggle for decades is the Stripped Bass. Currently, in Maryland, restrictions prohibit fishing for Stripped Bass in certain time periods, including spawning seasons and times of the year when water temperature is known to be hottest. The latter reason is because high water temperatures mean the fish require more oxygen. Fishing for them, even catch and release, stress the fish and lead to more unintentional fish deaths. In addition to these seasonal restrictions, Stripped Bass must be at least 19 inches and each boat is allowed to keep only one fish per person on the boat. These restrictions have kept the population afloat but are not perfect and are in constant flux due to push back from fishermen. There are also separate laws and regulations for commercial fishing which are less strict and undo some of the work the regulations on general fishing have.

	            The purpose of the analysis performed in this study is to try to further understand the patterns of water quality in the Chesapeake Bay region. Specifically, both dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll amounts in the water will be studied in an effort to ultimately to predict when those aspects of water quality are going to reach levels that are dangerous to the wildlife in the area. This type of analysis could be used as a tool for possibly regulating fishing in certain areas where known conditions will likely lead to lower dissolved oxygen levels. Additionally, if the analysis finds pattern areas where this is happening, local regulations could be implemented to reduce runoff from agriculture in these specific problem areas rather than enforcing those regulations for the entirety of the region. This type of regulation would be much more feasible in practice.
